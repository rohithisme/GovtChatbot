Where a resignation has not become effective and the officer wishes to withdraw it, it is open to the authority which accepted the resignation either to permit the officer to withdraw the resignation or to refuse the request for such withdrawal. Where, however, a resignation has become effective, the officer is no longer in Government service and acceptance of the request for withdrawal of resignation would amount to re-employing him in service after condoning the period of break.

The Government servant’s earlier service will not count for fixation of pay, increment or leave.

The words ‘his old pay’ in the proviso of the rule should be held to include not only the rate at which the individual was drawing his officiating pay on the crucial date but also the time-scale of pay in which he was drawing that pay.

Cases in which the revised scale of pay takes effect from a date prior to the date of suspension.

Cases in which the revised scale of pay takes effect from a date falling within the period of  suspension - (a)    Under suspension an officer retains a lien on his substantive post. As the expression ‘holder of a post’ occurring in Rule 30 includes also a person who holds a lien or a suspended lien on the post even though he may not be actually holding the post, such an officer should be allowed option under Rule 30 even while under suspension. The benefit of option will however, practically accrue to  him  in  respect  of  the  period  of  suspension,  only  after  his reinstatement,  depending  on  the  fact  whether  the  period  of suspension is treated as duty or not. (b)    An officer, who does not retain a lien on a post the pay of which is changed, is not entitled to exercise the option under Rule 30.

Government Decision No. 1 *At present charge allowance of the non gazetted officer for his holding additional charge of a gazetted post is being authorised by the office of the Accountant General based on the sanction of competent authorities, in the same way as pay and allowances of a gazetted officer is concerned. This practice has since been reviewed in the light of the procedure followed in some of the Audit and Account offices of other States. It has been decided that no authorisation from the office of the Accountant General is necessary in case of additional charge arrangements from 1st April 1963 onwards, as holding of additional charge of a gazetted post does not alter the status of a non gazetted officer to that of a gazetted officer. According to the changed procedure, the additional charge allowance will be drawn and paid by the Head of Office in the same manner as his regular pay and allowances are drawn. The Drawing Officer should however satisfy himself that there is proper sanction of the competent authority for the *[G O(P) No. 312/1963/Fin., Dated 29/05/1963] additional charge arrangements and that the officer has actually held the additional charge of the post during the period for which the charge allowance is drawn and also that the rate of allowance sanctioned and drawn is as per rules etc. The charge allowance thus drawn may be continued to be debited to the same head of account to which the pay of the non-gazetted officer is debi"

Government Decision No. 2 The following criteria will be followed to distinguish between ‘full additional charge’ and ‘discharge of current duties’:-(i)   An officer appointed to hold ‘full additional charge’ of a post has to perform all the administrative, financial and statutory functions and duties in respect of that post. (ii)    An officer appointed to discharge current duties of a post need attend only to the work of a routine nature in respect of that post. The posts in respect of which additional charge arrangements may be ordered shall be as classified below:- (I)   Posts not  in the same office, establishment or line of promotion or cadre.- Where the duties and responsibilities are clearly independent and are eligible for *special allowance, e.g., Labour Commissioner, holding charge of the post of Registrar of Co-operative Societies and Joint Secretary to Government holding charge of post of a Head of Department.

Note.- The reason for the non-grant of *special allowance In the above cases is that the superior officer is expected to supervise the work of the subordinates and the additional charge arrangements should not entitle him to extra remuneration. The work of the additional post should be redistributed among other subordinates in such a way that each one’s load of work is increased to a small extent that no one need be given *special allowance. (b) When the additional post is of equivalent and of the same rank as that of the regular post the following principles shall apply: (1) If additional charge arrangements are in respect of different territorial jurisdictions, the posts are definitely independent and in such cases *special allowance shall be admissible, e.g., Revenue Divisional Officer of one district/division holding charge of another district/ division and one Block Development Officer holding charge of another block. *[G O(P) No. 635/2002/Fin., Dated 19/10/2002] (2) If additional charge arrangements are in respect of posts in the same office and of the same rank, *special allowance"

Even for days he is not on tour outside 8 kilometres from headquarters he can draw Permanent Travelling Allowance.

So in case where the official rail journey is cancelled solely due to official reasons, the Government servant should after getting the refund in the usual manner from the Railway station prefer to the appropriate Railway authority concerned his claim for refund of cancellation charges (i.e., full ticket value excluding reservation charges and refund already received) on unused tickets supported by a certificate from his controlling authority to the effect that the journey had to be cancelled solely due to exigencies of service. When the officer himself is his own controlling officer for purposes of T.A. he may furnish his own certificate. The claim for the refund preferred on the Railways, should, however, be restricted to what it would be, had the officer booked and cancelled his journey by the shortest route, save in exceptional cases, where the route actually adopted by the officer is certified by the controlling officer or by the officer himself if he is his own controlling officer for T.A. purposes to be in the interest of public service."

Note 1:–A Compassionate allowance is, to all intents and purpose, a pension; and the rules regarding re-employment of pensioners are, therefore, equally applicable to the case of persons in receipt of a compassionate allowance. For purposes of re-employment, a compassionate allowance is the equivalent of a compensation or invalid pension and the recipient of the allowance, if re-employed is in the same position in respect of his title to draw his allowance during re-employment as the re-employed recipient of a compensation or invalid pension. Note 2 :– The retirement gratuity admissible under these rules is in lieu of a portion of pension.The pension equivalent of the gratuity should therefore be taken into account for determining the pay of an employee during re-employment.The table prescribed for the commutation of pension under these rules should be applied for the calculation of the pension equivalent."

The balance in excess of  `*100000, if any, would become payable on the production of a certificate of guardianship. It is essential that there should prima facie grounds for making payment on the production of an indemnity bond to the person claiming it. Such ground can exist only if he is shown by a sworn declaration to be a de-facto guardian and his bonafides have been ascertained. Even if a guardian has not yet been appointed by the court, if the minor and his property are in the custody of some person, such person is in law de-facto guardian. The authorities making the payment should therefore, require the person who comes forward to claim payment on behalf of the minor, to satisfy them by an affidavit that he is in charge of the person and property of the minor and is looking after it or that, if the minor has no property other than the gratuity the minor is in his custody and care. The affidavit so to be produced is in addition to the indemnity bond with suitable sureties.
