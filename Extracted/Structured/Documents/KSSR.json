    "Description": "(a)  The integrated cycle combining the rotation in clause (c) of rule 14 and the\nsub-rotation in sub- rule (2) of rule 17 shall be as specified in the Annexure to this Part. \nNotwithstanding  anything  contained  in  any  other  provisions  of  these  rules  or  in    the \nSpecial  Rules  if  a  suitable  candidate  is  not  available  for  selection  from  any  particular \ncommunity or group of communities specified in the Annexure, such vacancy shall be kept \nunfilled, notified separately for that community or group of communities for that selection \nyear  and  shall  be  filled  by  direct  recruitment  exclusively  from  among  that  community  or \ngroup  of  communities.    If  after  re-notification,  repeatedly  for  not  less  than  two  times,  no \nsuitable  candidate  is  available  for  selection  from  the  respective  community  or  group  of \ncommunities,  the  selection    shall  be  made  from  available  Other  Backward  Classes \n\n\fcandidates.  In the absence of Other Backward Classes candidates, the selection shall be \nmade from available Scheduled Castes candidates and in their absence, the selection shall \nbe made from available Scheduled Tribes candidates. \n\nExplanation.____ \n\nOne 'selection year' for the purpose of this rule shall be the \n\nperiod from the date on which the rank list of candidates comes \n\ninto force to the date on which it expires. \n\nNote.___\n\nAll pending uncompensated turns of vacancies such as temporarily passed \n\nover, no candidate available and non-joining duty as on the 2nd February, \n2006, shall be compensated.  \n\n(b)\n\nIf a suitable candidate is not available for selection from the group of communities\nclassified as 'Scheduled Castes' in the turn allotted from such group in the Annexure,the \nsaid group shall be passed over and the post shall be filled up by a suitable candidate from \nthe group of communities classified \"Scheduled Tribes\" and vice-versa. \n\n(c) The  benefit  of  the  turn  forfeited  to  Scheduled  Castes  or  Scheduled  Tribes\ncommunities by reason of it being passed over under sub-rule(b) shall be restored to it, at \nthe earliest possible opportunity, if a suitable candidate from that particular community or \ngroup is available for selection by making adjustment against the claims of the Scheduled \nCaste  or  Scheduled  Tribe  community  that  derived    the  extra  benefit  by  reason  of  such \npassing over. \n\n(d) Reservation to a category of posts shall not exceed  50 % of the total number of\n\nvacancies for which selection is resorted to in a selection year: \n\nProvided that the 50 % ceiling to reservation specified above shall not apply to the \nfilling up of any number of reserved vacancies kept unfilled and notified separately as per \nsub-rule  (a)  of  Rule  15  to  be  filled  exclusively  by  direct  recruitment  from  among  a \ncommunity or group of communities: \n\nProvided further that such class of vacancies to be filled up in that year or in any \nsucceeding year or years shall not be considered together with the vacancies of the year in \nwhich  they  are  being  filled  up  for  determining  the  ceiling  of  50  %  of  the  total  number  of \nvacancies of that year."
