Such sealed bags which cannot be deposited in the currency chest should be accounted for as valuable property in the Safe Custody Register Form T.R. 28 until the final disposal of the case, i.e., they should be excluded from the treasury balance by making a debit to the head “Suspense-Payments in Cash”, which will be cleared on the close of the case.

At sub treasuries where a permanent currency chest is not maintained, temporary chests for period not exceeding six months may be opened during the revenue collecting season, in order that the money collected at the sub treasury may be available at once for transfer through currency.

Explanation.—Under the provisions of the Reserve Bank of India Act, the  amount  of  currency  and  bank  notes  in  circulation, which constitute the liabilities of the Issue Department of  the  Bank,  should  not  exceed  the  assets  of  that department held in gold, sterling securities, rupee coin (including rupee notes), and rupee securities. A portion of  these  assets  is  held  in  the  various  currency  chests in the form of rupee coin and rupee notes. The currency and  bank  notes  held  in  these  chests  are  notes  in circulation but pass into circulation only when they are transferred to the treasury balances. Assuming that there are  no  transactions  elsewhere,  the  deposit  of  currency and bank notes in a currency chest decreases the amount of such notes in a circulation and the deposit of rupees and  rupee  notes  inthe  chest  increase  the  assets  of  the Issue Department of the Bank. A deposit notes or coin in a currency chest thus enables the Bank to issue notes elsewhere    upto    the      amount      deposited  without increasing the total amount of the notes in circulation. If, therefore, a transfer of funds from the treasury balance at ‘A’ to the treasury balance at ‘B’ is required, this can be  effected  at  short  notice  and  without  the  actual remittance of coin or notes by transferring money from the  treasury  balance  to  the  currency  chest  at  ‘A’  and transferring  the  same  amount  from  them  enables  the treasury balance at a treasury or sub treasury to be kept at a low figure, as it is always possible to replenish the balance quickly by a transfer of money from the currency chest.

The claim should supported by all the relevant certificates which  the  Head  of  the  Office  is  required  to  furnish  in  the  normal circumstances. However in respect of the certificates which solely depend on the personal knowledge of the government servant, but which obviously cannot be furnished by the Head of the Office, the Head of Office should record, if he is satisfied about the correctness of the claim, a certificate to the effect that “the  claim  is  not  susceptible  of  verification;  but  is  considered reasonable”. Further, as the claim would be the last one in respect the deceased government servant, the requisite payment in the case of a government servant whose pay is drawn on a gazetted government servant’s bill form, shall be made only after the Head of the Office has satisfied himself by reference to the Accountant General, the Departmental authorities concerned if any, and his own records that there are no demands outstanding against him. In the case of other government servants, payment may be made without reference to the Accountant General on the responsibility of the Head of the Office concerned. The amount so withdrawn should be disbursed to the claimant or claimants determined with due regard to the provisions of Article 95 of the Kerala Financial Code, Volume I, after obtaining a formal receipt, stamped wherever necessary, from the rightful claimant or claimants."

Such transfers from and to the currency chests should be reported to the Director so as to enable him to verify whether the Treasury Officers are promptly transferring surpluses of cash to the currency chests. When a surplus of small coin accumulates in any  treasury  in  his  district,  the Treasury  Officer  should,  if  possible,  order that it be remitted within the district to another treasury which needs it or to the Bank; when that is not possible he should request the Currency Officer, Madras  to  order  the  remittance  of  the  surplus  to  some  place  outside  the district"

(iv) Mint  remittances  i.e.,  remittances  of  uncurrent  coin,  or  coin withdrawn from circulation, from a treasury to a Mint. NOTE—Currency remittances i.e., remittances of notes or rupees from one currency chest to another or between a currency chest and the Issue Department  of  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India,  Madras,  do  not  affect the Government account since the contents of the currency chests are  property  of  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India. A  remittance  of  this kind  does  not  involve  locking  up  any  Government  funds,  and remittances of notes or rupees should therefore be sent wherever possible, as currency remittances. Subject to any general or special instructions that may be issued in this behalf by the Currency Officer, Madras,  the  provisions  of  Rules  324  to  368  below  regarding remittances  of  coin  and  notes  should  be  followed  in  regard  to currency remittances also."
