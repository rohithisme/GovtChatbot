[RULE 3

        (b)      such departmental proceeding, if not instituted while the   employee was in

service, whether before his retirement or during his re-employment,

(i)       shall not be instituted save with the sanction of the Government;

(ii)       shall not be in respect of any event which took place more than   four

years before such institution; and

(iii)          shall  be  conducted  by  such  authority  and  in  such  place  as  the

Government  may  direct  and  in  accordance  with  the  procedure

applicable to departmental proceeding in which an order of dismissal

service;

        (c)      **no such judicial proceedings, if not instituted while the employee was in

  (d)    The Public Service Commission shall be consulted before final orders are passed.

         (a)      a departmental proceeding shall be deemed to be instituted on the date on

which the statement of charges is issued to the employee or pensioner or

if the employee has been placed under suspension from an earlier date, on

such  date;  and

 (b)     a judicial proceeding shall be deemed to be instituted-

   (ii)

in the case of a civil proceeding, on the date of presentation of the

plaint in the Court.

 Note 1:– As  soon  as  proceedings  of  the  nature  referred  to  in  this  rule  are
instituted  the  authority  which  institutes  such  proceedings  should

without delay intimate the fact to the Audit Officer.  The amount of

pension withheld under this rule should not ordinarily exceed one–

third of the pension originally sanctioned.  In fixing the amount of

pension to be so withheld regard should be had to the consideration

whether the amount of the pension left to the pensioner in any case

would be adequate for his maintenance.

Note 2:– The word ‘pension’ used in this rule does not include death-cum-

retirement-gratuity.  Liabilities fixed against an employee or **pensioner

can be recovered from the death-cum-retirement gratuity payable to

him without the departmental/judicial proceedings referred to in this

rule,  but  after  giving  the  employee  or  **pensioner  concerned  a

reasonable opportunity to explain.

 Note 3:–* The liabilities of an employee should be quantified either before or after

retirement and intimated to him before retirement # if possible or after

retirement within a period of three years on becoming pensioner.The

liabilities of pensioner should be quantified and intimated to him.

Ruling No. 1

                Amounts due from a Government employee or **pensioner to Government

Companies, Local Bodies, Co-operative Societies, etc., though not treated as

@ Ruling No. 2

                      According  to  proviso (a)  under  this  rule,  departmental  proceedings,

if instituted while the employee was in service, whether before his retirement

or during his re-employment, shall after the final retirement of the employee

be deemed to be a proceeding under this rule and shall be continued and

concluded by the authority by which it was commenced in the same manner

as  if  the  employee  had  continued  in  service.   A  doubt  was  raised  as  to

whether in the case of an employee whose case falls within the purview of

the proviso and proceedings against whom were instituted by an authority

subordinate to Government, order for withdrawal/ withholding of pension

can  be  passed  by  the  subordinate  authority  on  the  conclusion  of  the

proceedings.  The function of the Disciplinary Authority is only to reach a

finding on the charge and to submit a report recording its findings to the

Government.  Government will then consider the findings and take a final

decision.  In case Government decide to take further action under Rule 3 the

Government  will  serve  the  person  concerned  with  a  show-cause  notice

specifying the action proposed to be taken under this rule and the person

concerned  will  be  required  to  submit  his  reply  to  the  show-cause  notice

within such time as may be specified by the Government.  The Government

will consider the reply in consultation with the Public Service Commission

and pass necessary orders in the name of the Governor.

                    The above procedure in regard to the issue of show-cause notice will also

apply to a case where the Governor functions as the Disciplinary Authority.

should be obtained for recovering the liabilities from the death-cum-retirement

gratuity payable to him.What contemplated is only a communication of such

liabilities to him so as to enable him to submit his explanation before the recovery

is effected.  It should be specifically stated in the communication that if no reply

is received within 30 days of its issue, it will be presumed that the employee or

**pensioner has no explanation to offer and that further action will be taken on

that  basis.

3-A.(a)       Where any departmental or judicial proceedings is instituted under Rule 3 or

where a departmental proceeding is continued under clause (a) of the proviso

thereto, against an employee who has retired on attaining the age of compulsory

retirement or otherwise he shall be paid during the period commencing from

the  date  of  his  retirement  to  the  date  on  which,  upon  conclusion  of  such

proceeding final orders are passed, a provisional pension not exceeding the

maximum pension which would have been admissible on the basis  of his

qualifying service up to the date of  retirement, or if he was under suspension

on the date of retirement up to    the date immediately preceeding the date on

which    he  was  placed  under  suspension,  but  no  gratuity  or  death-cum-

retirement gratuity shall be paid to him until the conclusion of such proceeding

and the issue of final orders thereon.

       (b)     Payment of provisional pension made under clause (a) shall be adjusted against
the final retirement benefits sanctioned to such employee upon conclusion of

the aforesaid proceeding, but no recovery shall be made where the pension

finally sanctioned is less than the provisional pension or the pension is reduced

or withheld either permanently or for a specified period.

Note:–The  grant of pension under this rule shall not prejudice operation of
Rule 59 when final pension  is sanctioned upon conclusion of the
proceeding.

CHAPTER  IV

     CONDITIONS OF GRANT OF PENSION

      Section I – Classification of Pensions

32.          Pensions are divided into four classes, the rules for which are prescribed

in this chapter:-

(a)   Compensation Pensions

(b)   Invalid Pensions

(c)   Superannuation Pensions

(d)   Retiring Pensions

      Section  II  –  Compensation  Pensions

33.            If an employee is selected for discharge owing to the abolition of a permanent
post,  he  shall,  unless  he  is  appointed  to  another  post  the  conditions  of

which are deemed by the authority competent to discharge him, to be at least

equal to those of his own, have the option:

(a)    of taking any compensation pension or gratuity to which he may be

entitled for the service he has already rendered, or

(b)     of accepting another appointment or transfer to another establishment
even on a lower pay, if offered, and continuing to count his previous
service for pension.

34.        Selection for discharge.–

          The selection of the employee to be discharged upon the reduction of an

establishment  should  prima  facie  be  so  made  that  the  least  charge  for

compensation pension will be incurred.

35.           The discharge of an employee to make room for another better qualified is not

the abolition of an appointment within the meaning of Rule 33; the abolition

must produce a real saving to Government.  Particulars of the saving effected

44

  CHAPTER III]              CONDITIONS OF GRANT OF PENSION       RULES 35-40

          should be fully setforth in every application for compensation pension.

The saving should always exceed the cost of pension; otherwise it may

perhaps be better to postpone the reduction of establishment or abolition

of appointment.

36.        No pension is admissible to an employee for the loss of an appointment on

discharge after the completion of a specified term of service.

37.      No pension may be awarded for the loss of a compensatory allowance or

special pay.

38.        If it is necessary to discharge an employee in consequence of a change in the

nature of the duties of his office, the case should be referred to the Government,

who will deal with it in accordance with the rules laid down in this section as to

notice of discharge and compensation pension or gratuity.

39.        If of two appointments held by an employee only one is abolished and it is

desired to give him an immediate pension in respect of the abolished post,

the case should be referred to Government .

40.           Reasonable notice should be given to an employee in permanent employment

before his services are dispensed with on the abolition of his office.  If in any

case notice of at least three months is not given, and the employee has not

been provided with other employment on the date on which his services are

dispensed  with,  then  with  the  sanction  of  Government  a  gratuity  not

exceeding his emoluments for the period by which the notice actually given

to him falls short of three months,  may be paid to him, in addition to the

pension to which he may be entitled under Rules 64 to 70 but the pension
shall not be payable for the period in respect of which he received a gratuity

in lieu of notice.

   Note 1:–  The gratuity prescribed in this Rule is not granted as compensation

for loss of employment but only in lieu of notice of discharge, with a

view to mitigate the hardship caused to an employee by the sudden

45

RULES 40-41]                    KERALA  SERVICE  RULES                         [PART III

loss of employment.   When therefore an employee discharged without

notice is provided with some other employment on the date on which

his service are dispensed with, whether that employment be in qualifying

or non qualifying service, he is not entitled to any gratuity.

  Note 2:– Unless it contains and express statement to the contrary, an order
for the abolition of an office or appointment shall not be brought into

operation till the expiry of three months after notice has been given to

the  employees  whose  services  are  to  be  dispensed  with  on  such

abolition. The immediate Head of the Office or the Department will be

held responsible for any unnecessary delay in giving such notice.  In

the case of an employee on leave, the order shall not be brought    into

operation until the leave expires.

  Note 3:– ‘Emoluments’ in this rule means the emoluments or leave allowances
(or  partly  the  one,  partly  the  other),  which  the  employee  would  be

receiving during the period in question, had the notice not been given

to him.

Government  Decision

             The gratuity paid in lieu of notice on abolition of an appointment should

be  charged  to  the  particular  department  to  which  the  pay  of  the

appointment was debited before its abolition.

41.          Rules requiring the refund of the compensation gratuity on re-employment,

apply to a gratuity awarded under rule 40, if the employee is permanently re-

employed within three months from the date of notice.  But the employee
need not refund that proportion of his gratuity under this rule, which the

interval  of  his  non-employment  bears  to  the  whole  period  for  which  the

gratuity is given.  If the employee is re-employed only temporarily he need

refund no part of his gratuity but if such temporary employment is foreseen,

the gratuity should be proportionately reduced.

                                              Section III – Invalid Pensions

42.  (1)      Where the Government / pension sanctioning authority have / has reason
to  believe  that  an  employee  is  suffering  from  a  contagious  disease,  or

physical or mental disability or infirmity which in their / its opinion interferes

with the efficient discharge of his duties, they / it may direct him to undergo

medical examination by a Medical Board or Medical Officer with a view to

ascertain whether he may be retired from service on invalid pension.

           (2)    *An invalid pension shall be granted to an employee who, having appeared on
the directions of the Government / pension sanctioning authority under sub-

rule (1) or on his own application, before a duly constituted Medical Board or

Medical Officer is certified by such Medical Board or Medical Officer to be

permanently  incapacitated  by  a  contagious  disease  or  physical  or  mental

disability or infirmity for the public service or for the particular branch of it to

which he belongs.

         (3)   # In the case of an employee who is invalidated under this rule irrespective
of the length of service, put in by him the actual period of his qualifying

service  as  on  the  intended  date  of  invalidation  shall  be  increased  by  a

period of 5 years subject to the condition that the total qualifying service

after allowing the weightage shall not exceed 30 years and the weightage

shall not exceed the difference between the age of superannuation and the

age at the date of invalidation. Fractions, if any in the qualifying service so

arrived at shall be rounded to the nearest completed year, that is, fraction

of less than half year shall be ignored and half year and above shall be

rounded to the next completed year.

                         Rules regarding Medical Certificates

43.      The incapacity for service must be established by a medical certificate

attested as follows:-

     (a)      By a Medical Board, in the case of all gazetted Government employees
whose pay as defined in Rule 12(23), Part I of these Rules, exceeds
` 500 per mensem.

    (b)    In other cases, by a Medical Officer not below the rank of a Civil Surgeon.

   (c)  No Medical certificate of incapacity for service may be granted unless the
applicant  produces  a  letter  to  show  that  the  Head  of  his  Office  or

Department is aware of his intention to appear before the Medical Officer.

The Medical Officer shall also be supplied by the Head of the Office or

Department in which the applicant is employed with a statement of what

appears from Official records to be the applicant’s age.  Where the applicant

has a Service Book, the age therein recorded should be reported.

Note:– Reciprocal arrangements have been entered into with the Mysore

Government to the effect that employees including Police personnel

of one State while staying in the other will be examined free of cost

by  a  medical  Board  or  a  Medical  Officer  employed  under  the

Government of the State concerned for the purpose of invalidating

from Government Services.  A medical requisition from the competent

authority  will  be  required  before  the  medical  examination  is

conducted.

    Exception : - Last Grade Employees of the Forest Department who have attained
the  age  of  fifty-five  may  be  granted  invalid  pension  without  the

production of the medical certificate.  It is enough if the Head of the
Department certifies to their incapacity for further service.

Ruling

               If an applicant suffering from any disease curable by operation refuses

to undergo operation and is therefore invalidated, no pension or gratuity

is admissible.  Each case of invalidation on account of curable disease

48

 CHAPTER III]      CONDITIONS OF GRANT OF PENSION           [RULES 43-44

should be decided on merits.The Head of Departments/Offices should

forward such cases with the recommendation of the pension sanctioning

authority / Head of the Department for the orders of the Government.

44.   (a)    A Succinct statement of the medical case and of the treatment adopted,

should, if possible, be appended in the following form:-

  (1)   Name:

                 ( To be filled in by the applicant in the   presence of the Medical

Officer who issues the medical certificate or the Medical Board

constituted for the purpose, as the case may be)

  (2)   Appointment held by the Applicant:

  (3)   Age (years):

  (4)   Total  Service (years):

  (5)   Service in India (years):

  (6)   Previous period of leave of absence on Medical Certificate:

  (7)   Habits:

  (8)   Disease:

  (9)   Treatment adopted :

  Note:- The details required to fill in item numbers 2,3,4,5 and 6 have to be

furnished by the Head of the Office in which the applicant is employed.

          (b)       If the examining Medical Officer, although unable to discover any specific
disease in the employee considers him incapacitated for further service by

general debility while still under the age of fifty  five years, he should give

detailed reasons for his opinion, and if possible a second medical opinion

should always in such a case be obtained.

          (c)       In a case of this kind, special explanation will be expected from the Head of the

49

  RULES 44-46]                    KERALA  SERVICE  RULES                         [PART III

Office or Department of the grounds on which it is proposed to invalid the
officer.

45.       A simple certificate that inefficiency is due to old age or natural decay from

advancing years, is not sufficient in the case of an employee whose recorded

age is less than fifty five years but a Medical Officer is at liberty, when certifying

that the employee is incapacitated for further service by general debility, to state

his reasons for believing the age to understated.

                        FORM OF MEDICAL CERTIFICATE

46.    (a)     The form of the certificate to be given in respect of an employee applying

for pension is as follows:-

                  “Certified  that  I  /  we  have  carefully  examined  AB  son  of  CD  a

… … … … … … . . i n t h e . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . … … … … … … … … …

…………….department.  His  age  is  by  his  own  statement

…………………..Years and by appearance about ………….years.  I / we

consider AB, to be completely and permanently incapacitated for further

service of any kind in the Department to which he belongs in consequence

of ………………..(here state disease or cause). His incapacity does not

appear to me / us to have been caused by irregular or intemperate habits”.

     Note:– If the incapacity is obviously the result of intemperance substitute for the

last  sentence:  “In  my  /  our  opinion  his  incapacity  is  the  result  of

irregular or intemperate habits”.

                    If the incapacity does not appear to be complete or permanent, the certificate

should be modified accordingly and the following addition should be made: I

am /we are of opinion that AB, is fit for further service of a less laborious

character than that which he has been doing (or may, after resting for ….months,

be fit for further service of a less laborious character than that which he has

been doing)

        (b)      The object of the alternative certificate of incapacity is that an employee

50

  CHAPTER III]      CONDITIONS OF GRANT OF PENSION          [RULES 46-51

should, if possible, be employed even on lower pay, so that the expense of

pensioning him may be avoided.  If there be no means of employing him

even on lower pay, then he may be admitted to pension; but it should be

considered whether in view of his capacity for partially earning a living it

is necessary to grant to him the full pension admissible under rules.

       (c)       The above certificate does not give an employee any right of transfer
to any other Department; and an employee invalided on a certificate in

this form will receive either full pension admissible under rules or such

smaller  amount  as  may  be  decided  by  the  authority  empowered  to

sanction  the  pension.

47.         Special precautions in the Police .-The Inspector General and the District

Superintendents of Police should be on their guard against endeavours

to retire on invalid pension by police personnel who are capable of serving

longer.

48.          Medical Officers should confine themselves to recommending leave to such

policemen as are not likely to benefit by a further stay in hospital and should

not certify that a policeman is incapacitated for further service unless they

are officially requested to report upon his incapacity for further service.

49.        Medical Officers should be specially searching in their examination of the

physical unfitness of every applicant for pension, and whenever, the number

of applicants for pension is large, the examination should, if possible, be

conducted by two Medical Officers.

50.         Restrictions- An employee discharged on other grounds has no claim under
Rule 42, even though he can produce medical evidence of incapacity for

service.

51.           If the incapacity is directly due to irregular or intemperate habits, no pension

can be granted.  If it has not been directly caused by such habits, but has

been accelerated or aggravated by them, it will be for the authority by which

51

RULES 51-54]                    KERALA  SERVICE  RULES                         [PART III

the pension is grantable to decide what reduction should be made on this

account.

      Note :– The expression ‘irregular or intemperate habits’ occurring in this

rule refers to incapacity on account of drug habits or on account of

diseases resulting from immoral habits.  Cases where incapacity occurs

due to other causes, e.g., work at irregular hours due to exigencies of

service and not due to own volition, do not come under the purview of

this rule.

52.          Applicants to be discharged  - An employee who has submitted under Rule

43, a medical certificate of incapacity for further service, must not (except for

special reasons to be reported to the Government) be retained on duty pending

a decision on his application for pension, nor can be obtain leave of absence.

           Without the special orders of Government, duty after the date of such

medical certificate does not count for pension.

53.        The object of Rule 52 is to discourage tentative applications; but last grade

employee, who in the opinion of the Head of Office, is fit for light work may

be retained in employment till his pension is sanctioned.  Provided that his

post is not filled up till he retires, and that his service counts only to the date

of his medical certificate.

54.             Rule 52 refers only to the retention in duty of an employee who has furnished

a medical certificate in support of an application for invalid pension or gratuity.

The retirement of an employee who is absent on leave other than earned

leave when such certificate is submitted, may have effect from the termination
of his leave and the employee may continue to draw leave allowance to the

end of his leave.

      Note :–Where employees are invalidated when on long leave / leave not due

the date of invalidating shall be that following the expiry of the leave

already granted and he counts as service qualifying for pension the

52

CHAPTER III]        CONDITIONS OF GRANT OF PENSION         [RULES 54-56

period after the date of his invalidating certificate to the termination of

his leave and the officer may continue to draw leave allowance to the

end of his leave.

                          Section IV – Superannuation Pension

55.       A superannuation pension is granted to an officer entitled or compelled, by

rule, to retire at a particular age.

                          Section V – Retiring Pension

56.          A retiring pension is granted to an employee who retires voluntarily after 20

years of qualifying service subject to the following conditions:-

(i)    He shall give notice in writing to the appointing authority or the pension

sanctioning  authority  of  his  intention  to  retire  at  least  three  months

before the date on which he wishes to retire:

          * Provided that the employee may make a request in writing to the

appointing authority to accept  notice of less than three months giving

reasons therefore. On receipt of such request the appointing authority

may consider it for the curtailment of the period of notice of three months

on merits and if  it  is satisfied that the curtailment of the period  of

notice will not cause any administrative inconveniance, the appointing

authority may relax the requirement of notice of three months on the

condition that the employee shall not apply for commutation of a part

of his pension before the expiry of the period of notice of three months.

     (ii)      If  the retirement  of   the  employee  takes  place while  on  leave  not
due, the  retirement  shall  be  effective  from  the  date  of   commencement

of   leave and  the  leave  salary  paid, if  any,  shall  be  recovered  either

from  the Death-Cum- Retirement Gratuity payable to him or otherwise;

launched in a Court of  Law against the officer;

    (vi)    Cases  in  which  permission  cannot  be  given  by  the  appointing

56A.     **At any time after a Government employee has completed thirty years of

qualifying service, he may be required by the appointing authority to retire

in the public interest, provided that the appointing authority shall give in

this behalf, a notice in writing to the Government Servant at least 3 months

before the date on which he is required to retire in the public interest or 3

months pay and allowances in lieu of such notice.

   Note  :–    In  order  that  the  powers  vested  in  the  appointing  authority  are
exercised  fairly  and  impartially  and  not  arbitrarily  the  following

guidelines must be followed.

        (1)     The criteria, to be followed by the appointing authority are:-

  (a)     Government employees whose integrity is doubtful will be retired.

  (b)    Government employees who are found to be ineffective will also be
retired.  The basic consideration in identifying such employee shall

be the fitness/competence of the employee to continue in the post,

which he is holding.  If he is not found fit to continue in his present

post,  his  fitness/competence  to  continue  in  the  lower  post  from

where he had been previously promoted, shall be considered.

(c)       While the entire service record of an officer shall be considered for the

purpose, no employee shall be retired on grounds of ineffectiveness if

his service during the preceding 5 years or where he has been promoted

to a higher post during that 5 years period, his service in the higher

post has been satisfactory.

(d)       No employee shall ordinarily be retired on ground of ineffectiveness

if in any event; he would be retiring on superannuation within a

period of 1 year from the date of consideration of his case.

powers conferred by this rule, the appointing authority shall record its

opinion in the file that it has formed its opinion and that it is necessary

to  retire  the  Government  Servant  in  pursuance  of  the  above  rule,  in

public interest such opinion shall not arbitrary or based on collateral

grounds.

    (3)   The rules relating to premature retirement shall not be used,

(a)     To retire on grounds of specific acts of misconduct, as a short cut to

initiating formal disciplinary proceedings or

(b)     For reduction of surplus staff or as a measure of effecting general

economy  without  following  the  rules  and  instructions  relating  to

retirement.

     (4)  a)       In case the appointing authority comes to the conclusion that the officer
is not fit for being retained in the present post, but could be retained in

the next lower post from which he was promoted, a notice shall be served

in such a case on the employee retiring him from service in pursuance of

the provision of the relevant rule.  Simultaneously it may be explained to

him in a covering letter that his continuance in service after the completion

of 30 years of service could be considered if he is willing to be reverted

to  the  lower  post,  held  by  him  previously.    In  case  he  indicates  his

willingness to work in the lower post and gives a written request for

being so reverted, he may be retained in service and continued in the

lower post.

         (b)     Employees who seek reversion to lower posts in lieu of premature
retirement shall be made eligible for consideration for promotion

after  they  have  put  in  a  service  of  two  years  in  the  lower  post

      CHAPTER – V

                    Section I – Amount of Pension – General rules

57.         The amount of pension that may be granted is determined by the length
of service as setforth in Rules 64 to 70.  Fraction of a year, if any, in the
service will be rounded to the nearest completed year, i.e., fractions less
than half year, will be ignored and half year and above rounded to the
next completed year:

                 Provided that for purposes of minimum service (i.e., 10 years) and maximum
service (i.e., 30 years) for pension, fraction of less than a half year, if any, in
the qualifying service above 9 years and 29 years respectively will be rounded
to the next completed years, i.e., 10 years or 30 years as the case may be.

                Note 1:– The term “pension” includes gratuity, death-cum-retirement gratuity

and family pension also.

            Note 2:–The grant of a compassionate allowance being an “act of grace” the
grant of any further concession in the shape of rounding fraction
of a year will not be allowed.

58.           Pension shall be fixed in whole rupees, fraction, if any, in the calculation
of pension according to the rules being rounded off to the next higher
rupee.

      Note :– The term “pension” includes gratuity, death-cum-retirement gratuity,

compassionate allowance and family pension also.

59.         Award of full pension – (a) The full pension admissible under this rule is
not to be given as a matter of course, or unless the service rendered has
been  really  approved.(b)  If  the  service  has  not  been  thoroughly
satisfactory, the Government may make such reduction in the amounts as
they think proper.

      Note 1:– Government may review their orders if the affected employee makes
 a request within a period of three months from the date of orders.

     Note 2 :– This rule does not operate to authorize a reduction of ordinary pension

either to nothing or to a nominal amount.

Ruling  No.1

      1.       The power to reduce the pension under this rule has not been delegated

by Government to subordinate authorities.

 2.       If a subordinate authority considers that it is open to question whether
the  full  pension  admissible  under  rules  should  be  granted  to  an
employee  owing  to  his  unsatisfactory  character  and  conduct,  the
pension application shall be submitted to the Government for orders
with a concise statement of the unfavorable circumstances appearing
against that employee and a sufficient explanation thereof to enable
the Government to form an opinion as to the propriety of reducing the
pension.

      3.     Though Rule 59 (b) does not provide for an enquiry before taking
action, the person affected may be given an opportunity of being
heard to satisfy the principles of natural justice.  A detailed enquiry
is  not  necessary  for  reducing  the  pension,  under  this  rule.    But
before  ordering  a  reduction  of  pension  the  employee  concerned
may be given an opportunity to explain and vindicate himself as for
instance  when  irregularities  are  detected  after  retirement  and
departmental proceedings are not feasible under Rule 3 ibid.

Ruling  No.2

         * Reduction of pension in the case of retired employees cannot be ordered
under the Kerala Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules,
1960. In their case Rule 59 (b) of this Part is to be applied.  No elaborate
enquiry is necessary.  But the retired employee concerned should be given
an opportunity to explain and vindicate himself.

2,3,6 or 59 (b) of this Part it should be effected in whole rupees only so that
the  resultant  pension  may  be  paid  in  whole  rupees  even  after  effecting
reductions.

Government Decisions

 1.            In the case of an employee who is compulsorily retired as a measure of
penalty  and  sanctioned  a  reduced  pension  in  accordance  with  the
provisions of Rule 6 a further reduction under this rule may not be
made.

  2.  (a)    This  rule  cannot  be  used  directly  to  effect  a  penal  recovery,  but
Government are justified in making proof of a specific instance of fraud
or negligence by an employee, the grounds for a finding that his service
has not been thoroughly satisfactory within the meaning of this rule
for the purpose of reducing his pension.

  (b)  The measure of the reduction in the amount of pension made under this
rule should be the extent by which the employee’s service as a whole
has failed to reach thoroughly satisfactory, standard and any attempt
to equate the amount of reduction with the amount of loss caused to
Government is incorrect.

 (c)   This rule contemplates permanent reduction in the amount of pension
ordinarily admissible and does not admit of the reduction of the pension
payable in respect of any one particular year.

  3.         *Minimum pension is fixed in consideration of the bare subsistence
needs and given a delinquent officer a pension sufficient to maintain
a  subsistence  level,  will  not  therefore  be  misplaced  leniency.
Government have, therefore, decided that minimum pension will be
admissible even in cases where pension is ordered to be reduced as
a punishment.

60.          Limitation .– An employee entitled to pension may not take a gratuity instead

of pension.

61.         In the case of an employee who has any service under the Government of India
or of any other State, pension should not be fixed until it has been ascertained
whether  any  pension  is  payable  by  the  Government  of  India  or  other  State
Governments.

       Note 1 :–  The eligibility of a person to receive, the amount or share of

death-cum-retirement gratuity should be determined with reference

to the facts as they stand on the date of death of the Government

employee and any subsequent event (e.g. remarriage of widow,

marriage of an unmarried daughter, sister, etc.) will not affect that

entitlement.  If, however, a person who was entitled to receive the

reference to the facts as they stand on the date of retirement.

     Note 3 :– The after born child of deceased employee is also eligible to get his/

Government    Decision

                It has been brought to the notice of the Government that delay  is caused in
the payment of the share of death-cum-retirement gratuity due to a major

surviving member of the family of the deceased employee where, in the

absence of valid nomination, one major member of the family authorises

another to receive the share due to him.  The share due to one gratuitant can

be disbursed to another gratuitant according to the wishes of the former, so

long as he is not actually relinquishing his right to a share of gratuity, but

only authorising another member or members to receive payment on his

behalf.  It has been decided that in case where a gratuitant desires another

gratuitant  to  receive  his  share  on  his  behalf,  a  power  of  attorney  in  the

accompanying form given below should be insisted upon from the former.

The power of attorney   need not be registered in such cases, but may be got

attested  by  the  Tahasildar  concerned  as  required  by  law.   All  pension

sanctioning authorities are requested to follow the above procedure in future.

68.           @The amount of gratuity will be one half of the “emoluments” of an employee
for each completed year of qualifying service subject to a maximum of 15

times the “emoluments”.  In the case of invalid pension or in the event of

death of an employee while in service, the gratuity will be subject to a minimum

of 12 times the emoluments of the employee last drawn.  The maximum amount
of gratuity under this rule will, however, be limited to † ` 7 lakhs.

              The family of employees who die before completing 5 years qualifying service

will also be eligible for a gratuity equal to 6 times the emoluments of the officer at

the time of his death except in cases in which death occurs in the first year of

service when the gratuity admissible will be equal to two months’ emoluments.

persons specified in Rule  67.  This benefit will not be admissible if the employee

had commuted a portion of his pension before  death.  (Vide Rules in Appendix

X)

Ruling

             The expression “sums actually received” occurring in Rule 69 has been

used to indicate that all the amounts received by the employee by way of

pension  or  gratuity  should  be  taken  into  account  and,  accordingly,  in

addition to  pension and gratuity drawn by the deceased employee, the

temporary increase in pension should also be taken  into consideration

for determining the amount of residuary gratuity payable under Rule 69.

70.           The ‘emoluments’ for the purpose of the section will be reckoned in accordance

with Rule 62 provided that if the emoluments of an employee have been reduced

during the last twelve months of his service otherwise than as a penalty, ‘Average

emoluments’ as defined in Rule 63 may at the discretion of the authority which

has  power  to  sanction  the  gratuity  under  this  section,  be  treated  as  the

‘emoluments’.

and any gratuity which having become admissible to him under Rule 66 has
not been paid to him before death.

                While a nomination as also any change therein will normally be made by an

to  any  other  member  (including  minor  children  of  the  Government
employee’s family)

    EXTRAORDINARY  PENSION  RULES

Vide Rules 1 to 12 in Appendix XIII

    CHAPTER VII

        RE-EMPLOYMENT OF PENSIONERS

  Section I – General

91.             An employee may not retire with the view to being re-employed, and drawing
pension in addition to pay whether in the service of Government or of a

Local Fund.

92.           No person discharged on pension or gratuity shall be re-employed whether

temporarily or permanently without the sanction of Government.  When a

person who was formerly in the employment of the Government of India or

of any other State Government obtains re-employment, whether temporarily

or permanently, in Government service or in the service of a Local Fund, it

shall be incumbent on him to declare the amount of any gratuity, bonus or

pension granted to him in respect of the previous employment.  The order of

re-employment shall specifically state whether any deduction is to be made

from pension or salary as required by the rules of this Chapter and a copy of

the order should be communicated to the Audit Office.

               The attention of every employee who is re-employed should be specifically

called to the provisions of this chapter by the authority  re-employing him,

and by the Audit Officer whenever he becomes aware of such an appointment;

but the failure of such authority to do this will not be admitted as a ground

for condoning any breach of the regulations contained in this Chapter.

110

  CHAPTER VII]             RE-EMPLOYMENT  OF OF PENSION       [RULES 92-94

 Note 1:–A Compassionate allowance is, to all intents and purpose, a pension;

and the rules regarding re-employment of pensioners are, therefore,

equally applicable to the case of persons in receipt of a compassionate

allowance.  For purposes of re-employment, a compassionate allowance

is the equivalent of a compensation or invalid pension and the recipient

of the allowance, if re-employed is in the same position in respect of

his title to draw his allowance during re-employment as the re-employed

recipient of a compensation or invalid pension.

Note 2 :– The retirement gratuity admissible under these rules is in lieu of a

portion  of  pension.The  pension  equivalent  of  the  gratuity  should

therefore be taken into account for determining the pay of an employee

during re-employment.The table prescribed for the commutation of

pension under these rules should be applied for the calculation of the

pension equivalent.

93.            Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in  the  Chapter  an  injury  or  other

extraordinary pension sanctioned under Appendix XIII to these rules and

wound  or  injury  or  disability  pension  or  a  disability  addition  to  pension

awarded under the military rules or such pension awarded by the Government

of India or any other State Government shall continue to be drawn by a

retired person re-employed under the Government.  The amount of such

pension or addition to pension shall not be taken into account when fixing

the pay during re-employment.

                  Section II – Re-employment of Civil Pensioners

94.         Re-employment after Compensation Gratuity – An employee who has obtained
a compensation gratuity, if  re-employed in qualifying service, may either retain

his gratuity, in which case his former service, will not count for future pension, or

refund it and count his former service.

111

 RULES 95-96]                     KERALA  SERVICE  RULES                         [PART III

95.         The intention to refund must be  stated  immediately  on re-employment but

the refund may be made by monthly instalments of not less than one-third of

the employee’s salary and also not less than the whole gratuity divided by

the number of months which have elapsed since the end of the service for

which the gratuity was given.The right to count previous service does not

revive till the whole amount is refunded.

            (The equity of this rule is based upon the consideration that so long as the

refund of the gratuity is postponed, the employee avoids the risks and the

State loses the possibility of the gratuity lapsing absolutely to the public

treasury by the death or dismissal of the employee. A subsequent refund of

gratuity even with compound interest does not compensate the State for the

loss of this possibility meanwhile).

96.  (a)   An employee who has obtained a compensation pension, if re-employed,

may  retain  his  pension  in  addition  to  his  pay,  provided  that  if  he  is  re-

employed in a post paid from the General Revenues the pension shall remain

wholly or partly in abeyance if the sum of the pension and initial pay on re-

employment exceeds his pay at the time of his discharge, that is, an employee

can draw so much of pension only as will make his initial pay plus pension

equal to his pay at the time of his discharge.  Once the amount of the pension

has been fixed in conformity with the above condition the employee shall be

entitled to receive the benefits of increments in his new scale or promotion

to another scale or post without a future corresponding reduction in pension,

nor shall the amount of pension so fixed be varied during leave.  In the case,

however, of a pensioner re-employed in either a permanent or a temporary
appointment for bonafide temporary duty lasting for not more than a year,

the Government may allow the pension to be drawn in whole or in part even

though the sum total of pay and pension exceed his pay at the time of this

discharge.

  Note 1:– In the case of re-employment under a Local Fund, no deduction

112

 CHAPTER VII]              RE-EMPLOYMENT OF PENSIONERS       [RULES 96-99

need be made from a compensation pension.

  Note 2 :– The Government may permit an employee who has obtained a

compensation pension and afterwards re-employed in a permanent or

temporary  appointment  sanctioned  by  Government  to  draw  his  full

pension  in  addition  to  the  pay  and  allowances  of  the  appointment

irrespective of the period of such re-employment.

       (b)      If  his re-employment is in qualifying service he may either retain his

pension (subject to the proviso above stated) in which case his former service

will not count for future pension or cease to draw any part of his pension

and count his previous service. Pension intermediately drawn need not be

refunded.

    Note:–An employee counts his previous service under clause (b) if on re-

employment, his pension remains wholly in abeyance under proviso to

clause (a)

97.             If  an employee does not, within three months from the date of his re-

employment, exercise the option conceded by the above rule, of ceasing to draw

pension and counting his former service, he may not thereafter do so without

the permission of the Government.

98.            After invalid pension .– There is no bar to the re-employment of an employee

who has regained health after obtaining invalid pension or of an employee

invalidated as being incapacitated for employment in a particular branch of

the service.  The rules in such case as to refunding gratuity drawing pension

and counting service are the same as in the case of re-employment after

compensation  pension.

99.          After superannuation pension or retiring pension.–  An employee who is in

receipt of a superannuation or retiring pension shall not be re-employed or

113

  RULES 99-100]                     KERALA  SERVICE  RULES                     [PART III

continue to be employed in service paid from the General Revenues or from

a Local Fund except in public interests.

#100.      The pay of re-employed State Government employee who retired from a post

with pay scales currently in force will be the pay drawn at the time of retirement

minus basic pension. In the case of others, the pay drawn at the time of

retirement shall be updated and fixed at the appropriate stage in the scale of

pay of the post held at the time of retirement or the scale of pay of the post

of re-employment as the case may be, if it is a stage.  If it is not a stage, pay

will be fixed at the immediate lower stage and the difference being treated as

Personal Pay or at the minimum of the scale of pay when the pay arrived at is

less than the minimum.When appointments are made on re-employment basis

to a post carrying lesser scale of pay then fixation shall be made in the scale

of  pay  of  re-employment.    In  the  case  of  employees  other  than  State

Government employees, re-employment pay is to be fixed at the minimum of

the scale of pay of the re-employment post.  Re-employed pensioners are

entitled to the benefit of Dearness Allowance, House Rent Allowance and

City Compensatory Allowance applicable from time to time on the pay before

reducing pension but are not entitled to Dearness Relief on pension.  They

will also be allowed the benefit of annual increment with effect from 1st April,

1992.  Re-employed pensioners are not eligible for stagnation increment:

                Provided that the pay and allowances of re-employment pensioners during

the period from 1st January, 1996 to 6th June, 2000 shall be fixed as follows,

namely:-

       a.        Re-employed pensioners will be given pay minus pension and all other

allowances attached to the re-employed post.  They will be eligible to

get all pensionary benefits including Dearness Relief on pension due

to them in full.

      b.       The re-employed pensioners will be allowed the minimum of the scale of

pay of the post of retirement as revised from time to time, irrespective of

the scale of pay of the post of re-employment or the pay they had

drawn at the time of retirement whichever is higher.  In the case of

those who are re- employed in the post, the scale of pay which is

lower than the scale of pay of the post of retirement, pay will be fixed

in  the  scale  of  pay  of  the  post  of  re-employment,  limiting  it  to  the

maximum of such scale of pay, if pay at the time of retirement was

above it.  If pay drawn at the time of retirement is not a stage in the

relevant scale of pay, it will be fixed at the stage immediately below in

that scale, the difference being treated as Personal Pay to be absorbed,

in future increment.  All variants of pay, such as Special Pay, Personal

Pay, etc., included in the definition of ‘pay’ in sub-rule (23) of rule 12

Kerala Service Rules Part-I, and reckoned for pension will be reckoned

for computing re-employment salary.

       c.        The re-employed pensioners will be eligible to get Dearness Allowance,

House Rent Allowance, City Compensatory Allowance and periodic

increments.

     d.         Notwithstanding anything contained above, the excess amount, if any,
drawn prior to 7th June, 2000 including Interim Relief on re-employed
pay shall not be recovered .

Exception  I:-  In  the  case  of  retired  Supreme/High  Court  Judges,  the  re-
employment pay together with pension and pension equivalent of other

forms of retirement benefits may exceed ` 3,500 but shall not exceed
the pre-retirement pay.

Exception II:- Pensioners re-employed in part time condingent posts will be

exempted from the purview of  this rule in matter of fixation of pay.

 *Note 1 :– In the case of re-employed persons who had retired prior to 1988
Pay Revision and in whose case the basic pay plus Dearness Allowance
at 608 Points of All India Consumer Price Index at the time of retirement
was higher than the minimum of  scale of pay of the corresponding post
as revised in the 1988 Pay Revision Order, the basic pay in re-employment
will be fixed at the corresponding revised scale at the stage equal to the
total  consisting  of  the  pay  at  the  time  of  retirement  plus  Dearness
Allowance at 608 points of All India Consumer Price Index if not, the
stage immediately below in that scale.

*Note 2 :–The re-employed pensioners who retired prior to 1st March, 1992
will be allowed fixation of their re-employment pay at the appropriate
stage in 1992 Pay Revision Scale and where it does not fit in with a
stage in the scale of pay, it will be fixed at the stage immediately below
in that scale.  In the case of persons who were drawing pay less than
the minimum of the 1992 Pay Revision Scale, the pay will be fixed at the
minimum of that scale.  For fixation of pay in the 1992 revised scales,
basic pay at the time of retirement plus Dearness Allowance at 608
points of All India Consumer Price Index will be reckoned in the case of
those retired prior to 1st July, 1988

.*Note 3 :– In the case of those who retired prior to 1st January, 1996 and re-
employed thereafter the merger of Dearness Allowance allowed during
the subsequent Pay Revision since retirement wherever applicable will
have  to  be  notionally  added  to  update  the  pay  by  adding  Dearness
Allowance at 1510 points with effect from 1st March, 1997.

*Note 4 :–In the case of those retired prior to 1st July, 2004 and re-employed
thereafter, Dearness Allowance at 59% will have to be notionally added
to update the pay.

Government  Decision  No.1

            * In cases where the re-employment pay fixed under the above rule is less than the
minimum of the scale of pay of the post of the re-employment, the re-employment
pay will be fixed at such amount and it will not be enhanced to the minimum of
the scale

Government  Decision  No.2

                In cases where delays are likely to occur in determining the pension and
other pensionary benefits the re-employed person may be paid the full
pay of the post on provisional basis which will be inclusive of his pension
but will exclude an approximate amount of pension equivalent of gratuity
provided he executes an agreement in the appropriate form (vide Annexure
I to this section). He will also be required to furnish acquittance in the
prescribed form (vide Annexure II to this section) indicating receipt of
pay including pension.  The acquittance should be obtained from the re-
employed person concerned along with pay bill every month he is paid
provisionally.

               When the pension and other retirement benefits are ultimately sanctioned to
the re-employed person by the competent authority the pay would be fixed
after taking into account the pension and pension equivalent of other form of
retirement benefits and he will have no fresh claim for pensionary benefits in
respect of the past periods during which he drew the same along with the
provisional pay.   The   actual amount of pension equivalent of gratuity will be
adjusted against the gratuity to the extent it is different from the approximate
amount deducted from the pay of the post provisionally paid.

          This  will  apply  only  to  the  cases  of  State  Government  employees  re-

employed in the State Government.

101.        Except where it is otherwise expressly provided the rules in Section II of this
Chapter do not apply to an employee of the Defence Services who has been
granted a pension under military rules and who is re-employed under the
Government.  The claims of such  an employee to pay and allowances are
governed by Rule 102.  His pension for service in the Civil Department shall
not be affected by his military pension.

102.(a)(i)  In the case of re-employed military pensioners of all categories including
mustered-out pensioners, but excepting mustered-out pensioners of the ex-
Travancore Cochin State Forces whose case is dealt with separately below,
the pay otherwise admissible to them in the civil post will be reduced as
shown below :

rates with effect from the date of commencement of these rules.

Government  Decision

            **The reduction in civil pay contemplated in the sub-rule in respect of a

military pensioner re-employed is applicable throughout the re-employed

service and will be effected not only at the initial fixation but also on every

occasion  of  subsequent  promotion/revision  and  will  be  subject  to  the

condition that pay plus military pension and pension equivalent of other
forms of retirement benefit for the military service shall not exceed ` 3500 per
month.  The reduction will not, however be effected when an increment is

earned.    In  the  case  of  promotion/revision  of  pay  “the  pay  otherwise

admissible” (excluding reduction) shall be fixed under the normal rules in

Kerala  Service  Rules  with  reference  to  “the  pay  otherwise  admissible

excluding  reduction  and  including  increments”  and  then  the  reduction

contemplated in the sub-rule shall be effected.

    (ii)     The pay on re-employment in Civil Departments of retired military

personnel who received only a gratuity shall be fixed taking into

account the gratuity received from the military authorities.  For this

purpose,  the  pension  equivalent  of  the  gratuity  based  on  the

commutation table given in Appendix X will be arrived at and then

the pay on re-employment in the civil post fixed by applying the

table of calculation mentioned above.

commissioned training or were commissioned after 1st November 1962
may  on  their  appointment  in  Government  Service  to  unreserved

employed.   The  pay  so  arrived  at  should  not,  however,  exceed  the

basic pay (including the deferred pay but excluding other emoluments)

last drawn by them in the Armed Force.  When the minimum of the

scale of pay in the civil post to which a pensioner is re-employed is

more than the last pay drawn by him before retirement, his initial pay in

the civil post shall be fixed at the minimum of the scale of pay of the re-

employed post.

  (b)       In respect of mustered – out pensioners of the ex-Travancore-Cochin
State Forces who are provided with permanent alternate employment

in civil posts under the State Government, the question of any reduction

in their civil pay does not arise.  In the case of these mustered out

pensioners of the ex-Travancore – Cochin State Forces, who are not so

permitted to count their military service or who do not desire to have

their previous service counted for purposes of pension for the civil

post or those whose appointments in the civil post are only temporary,

their pay on re-employment will be governed by the same rules as are

applicable to ordinary military pensioners enunciated above.

the  new  service  combined  with  the  old,  the  whole  being  counted  as  one

service.

employed in pensionable service and retains the pension (See Rule 94) the

pension or gratuity admissible for his subsequent service is subject to the

following limitation, namely that the capital value of pension shall not be

greater than the difference between the value of the pension that would be

admissible at the time of the employee’s final retirement if the two periods of

service were combined, and the value of the pension already granted for the

previous service.

105.(a)  If a gratuity received for the earlier service has not been refunded gratuity or

pension (as the case may be) may be allowed for the subsequent service on

condition  that  the  amount  of  such  gratuity  or  the  present  value  of  such

pension plus the amount of the previous gratuity shall not exceed the amount

of  gratuity  of  the  present  value  of  the  pension  that  would  have  been

admissible and the gratuity received for the earlier service been refunded.

         (b)   If the amount of such gratuity or the present value of such pension, plus the
amount of the previous gratuity exceeds the amount of gratuity or of the

present value of the pension that would have been admissible if the gratuity

received  for  the  earlier  service  had  been  refunded,  the  excess  must  be

disallowed.

fortnight in advance of the date of commencement of pension and the fact
shall  be  reported  to  the  pension  sanctioning  authority.  If  the  amount  of
anticipatory pension is found to be in excess of the amount of final pension,
the  pension  sanctioning  authority  shall  serve  on  the  pensioner  a  notice
requiring him to refund the amount paid in excess within a period of 2 months
of the receipt of the notice by him. On his failure to comply with the notice,
the excess payment shall be adjusted in instalments from the future payments
of pension or the excess amount adjusted out of the balance of gratuity, if
any, as the pension sanctioning authority may decide. However, the excess
drawals of anticipatory gratuity shall not be required to be refunded by the
gratuitant.

       (2)    If the payment of the balance of the gratuity is desired to be made from the
Treasury or Sub-treasury from which the final pension is to be drawn, the
Audit  Officer  shall  authorize  the  payment  of  gratuity  after  adjusting  the
amount, if any, outstanding against the retired government employee. The
fact  of  the  issue  of  the  pension  payment  order  and  the  payment  of  the
balance of gratuity shall be promptly reported to the head of office and the
pension papers which are no longer necessary shall be returned to him by
the Audit Officer. He may also authorize the payment of the balance of the
gratuity even during the period of the currency of the anticipatory pension,
provided  that  the  amount  of  gratuity  has  been  finally  assessed  and  no

Government dues are outstanding against the Government employee, pending

recovery.

              In the case of non-gazetted employees the liabilities as noticed in audit

will be intimated by the Audit Office to the departmental officer. He will
communicate the same as required under the rule to the party to furnish

his explanation or objection, if any, within the period stipulated in the

Rule.  Meanwhile  the  balance  of  death-cum-retirement  gratuity  after

withholding the dues including liabilities pointed out by the departmental

officer will be authorized from the Audit Office with necessary intimation

to  the  party.  On  receipt  of  the  reply  from  the  departmental  officer  in

CHAPTER VIII]         APPLICATIONS / GRANT OF PENSION     [RULE 116-118

regard  to  the  party’s  explanation  on  or  objection  to  the  dues

communicated, further action either to adjust the amount withheld or to

release the same will be initiated by the Audit Office.  Similarly in the case

of  gazetted,  government  employees  the Audit  Office  will  observe  the

formalities before the final payment of death-cum-retirement gratuity.

117A.* If the amount of final pension granted to an officer is afterwards found to be

an excess of that to which he is entitled under the rules, the pensioner shall

be liable to refund such excess amount to Government. When any amount is

liable to be refunded under this rule, the sanctioning authority shall serve on

the pensioner a notice requiring him/ her to refund the amount paid in excess

within a period of two months from the date of receipt by him/ her of the

notice.  On  his/her  failure  to  comply  with  such  notice,  the  sanctioning

authority  shall  order  that  such  excess  amount  shall  be  adjusted  by  short

payments of pension in future in such number of instalments as the authority

may order. A similar procedure shall be adopted in the case of family pension

also.

118.       ‘Cases where death occurs while in service’ : –

form and the nomination subsists, the Head of the Office/Department or

the Audit Officer who is the custodian of the nomination shall, on receipt

Form 6A together with a copy of form 6 asking for necessary documents.

On their receipt, he shall draw up the pension papers and forward them to

the  pension  sanctioning  authority  .The  pension  sanctioning  authority

authority of the orders recorded by the pension sanctioning authority

       (2)    If the employee has not executed a nomination in the prescribed form or
in cases where the nomination made does not subsist, the head of the
office/department shall arrange to conduct an enquiry to ascertain who
are the surviving members of the family eligible to receive the death-
cum-retirement gratuity and family pension. On receipt of the enquiry
report in the form in Annexure III, he shall obtain from the surviving
eligible members an application in Form 6, draw up the pension papers in
respect of the deceased non-gazetted employee and forward them to the
pension sanctioning authority. If the claimant for family pension is the
father or the mother, etc., the Head of Office/ department should satisfy
himself that the conditions laid down in Rules 81, 84, and 90, as the case
may be are fulfilled before forwarding the pension papers to the pension
sanctioning  authority.  The  pension  sanctioning  authority  shall,  after
recording his orders sanctioning death-cum-retirement gratuity and family
pension, pass on the pension papers to the Audit Officer for authorizing the
payment of the amount of death-cum-retirement gratuity and issuing family
pension payment order. The enquiry report along with the application in
Form 6 from the surviving eligible members of the family of a deceased
Gazetted Government Employee shall be passed on to the Audit Officer who
shall complete the Form 6 and forward it to the pension sanctioning authority
for recording his orders for the payment of the death-cum-retirement gratuity
and the family pension.  After recording the orders of the Pension Sanctioning
authority  on  the  Pension  application,  it  shall  be  forwarded  to  the Audit
Officer  for  authorizing  payment  of  the  amount  of  death-cum-retirement-
gratuity and issuing Pension Payment Order.

     (3)     When the gratuity is payable under clauses (1) and (2) above to the minor. –

the person who produces a guardianship certificate. A descriptive roll in
duplicate of the person who may be authorized to receive payment should
accompany the application in Form 6;

             † Provided that where the minor child is under the care of a de facto guardian
while the natural guardian is alive and the natural guardian consents to the
payment of amount or share of the gratuity to the de facto guardian, it shall
be payable to de facto guardian, on production by him of-

     (i)           A certificate from the Tahasildar of the Taluk to the  effect that the minor

is under the care and custody of the de facto guardian;

   (ii)    The written consent of the natural guardian duly attested by two

witnesses;  and

    (iii)     An indemnity bond in Form 8 A

  Note 1 :–The legal position as to whom the capacity of minor natural guardian/
legal guardian, the share of a minor would be payable is explained as
under: -

              (i)       Where no valid nomination subsists. –

  (a)            When a share payable to minor sons or minor unmarried daughters
it should be paid to the surviving parent except in the case when
the surviving parent happens to be a Muslim lady, where, however,
there is no surviving parent, or the surviving parent   is a Muslim
lady, payment will have to be made to the persons producing the
guardianship certificate.

  (b)          When a share is payable to a widowed minor daughter production

of a guardianship certificate would be necessary.

  (c)          If in a rare case the wife herself happens to be a minor the death-
cum-retirement  gratuity  payable  to  her  shall  be  paid  to  the

persons producing the guardianship certificate.

  (d)          When there are no surviving members of the family as in items

(a),  (b),  (c)  and  (d)  of  Rule  71  and  the  death-cum-retirement

gratuity becomes payable to a  minor brother or a minor unmarried

sister, the payment should be made to the father or, in his absence

the mother of the beneficiary except in the case where the mother

happens to be a Muslim lady. If the death-cum-retirement gratuity

becomes payable to a minor child of a predeceased son, payment

should be made to the mother of the beneficiary except in the

case where the mother happens to be a Muslim lady. In these

cases too, if there is no surviving parent or the surviving parent

happens to be a Muslim lady,  the payment shall be made to the

person producing the guardianship certificate. If any share is

payable  to  a  widowed  minor  sister,  the  production  of  a

guardianship certificate would be necessary.

           (ii)         Where a valid nomination subsists. –

   (a)       Where the nomination is in respect of one or more of the minor
members of the family, the position stated above would apply.

    (b)        Where there is no family, the nomination in favour of an illegitimate
child, or a married sister would also be valid. The position would,

therefore, be as follows: -

  (i)         If the nominee is an illegitimate child, share will be payable to the
mother,  and,  in  her  absence  the  production  of  a  guardianship

certificate would be necessary.

  (ii)     If the share is payable a married minor girl, the share will be

payable to the husband.

   Explanation : The term “surviving parent” mentioned in Note 1 (i)

above does not include “ surviving step mother”.

               Note 2 :–Payment of death-cum-retirement gratuity to the extent

140

   CHAPTER VIII]         APPLICATIONS / GRANT OF PENSION           [RULE   118

    of  `*100000 (or the first  ` *100000 where the amount payable exceeds
`*100000) in favour of a minor may be made to his/her guardian
in the absence of a natural guardian, without the production of
a formal guardianship certificate but subject to the production
of an indemnity bond in Form 8A with two suitable solvent
sureties  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  sanctioning  authority.  The
balance in excess of  `*100000, if any, would become payable
on the production of a certificate of guardianship.

           It is essential that there should prima facie grounds for making
payment on the production of an indemnity bond to the person
claiming it. Such ground can exist only if he is shown by a sworn
declaration to be a de-facto guardian and his bonafides have been
ascertained. Even if a guardian has not yet been appointed by the
court, if the minor and his property are in the custody of some
person, such person is in law de-facto guardian. The authorities
making the payment should therefore, require the person who
comes forward to claim payment on behalf of the minor, to
satisfy them by an affidavit that he is in charge of the person
and property of the minor and is looking after it or that, if the
minor has no property other than the gratuity the minor is in
his custody and care. The affidavit so to be produced is in
addition to the indemnity bond with suitable sureties.

         Note 3 :–In cases where the surviving parent happens to be a
Muslim lady and where the aggregate amount of the gratuity
due to her minor children does not exceed one thousand rupees,
the share of the death-cum-retirement gratuity due to them will
be  paid  to  her  on  production  of  a  certificate  issued  by  the
Tahasildar in whose jurisdiction the beneficiaries live, that the
minor children are under her care and custody.

 CHAPTER IX

  PAYMENT OF PENSION

       Section I-General

119.    *Apart from special orders, an ordinary pension is payable from the date in which

the pensioners ceased to be borne on the establishment

   Note :–**The pension of an employee, who, under rule 40, has received a gratuity
in lieu of notice of discharge is not payable for the period in respect of
which the gratuity is paid.

120.         The preceeding rule applies to ordinary, not to special cases. If, under special
circumstances a pension is granted @ after three years an employee has retired,
retrospective effect should not be given to it without the special orders of the
Government which granted it; in the absence of special orders, such a pension
takes  effect  only  from  the  date  of  sanction.@  No  Government  sanction  is
necessary, if the pension is granted within three years from the date of  retirement.

Section II- Payment

121.        The order sanctioning a pension, death-cum-retirement gratuity/residuary, or
family pension should be forwarded to the Audit Officer with the application, for
issue of authority to make payments.

               The Audit Officer will then communicate to the Officer who is to pay the pension,
gratuity or family pension, authority to make the payment; in the case of pension
or family pension such authority will be a Pension Payment Order.

122.    Procedure in paying.– A gratuity is paid in a single sum, and not by instalments, on

receipt of the Audit Officer’s authority.

  Note :– #  In the event of  revision of pay, pension and dearness allowance
with retrospective effect, Government reserves the right to release the
residuary gratuity in instalments.

is terminated, the reason, for the reduction, dismissal, removal, suspension

or the termination of the probation, as the case may be, should always be

briefly stated; ‘Reduced for inefficiency’, ‘probation terminated on grounds

of unfitness’, etc. Interruptions in service and leave not counting for pension

should specifically be recorded in the Service Book.  The details of all penalties

and rewards should also be recorded in the service Book.  In all the above

cases  the  number  and  date  of  orders  of  competent  authority  should  be

recorded against the relevant entries in the Service Book along with which

copies  of  the  orders  should  be  filled.    The  Head  of  Office  should  make

efficient arrangements for these entries being made with regularity.  The

duty should not be left with the non-gazetted employee concerned.

145.     Personal certificates of character must not, unless the head of the department

so directs, be entered in the Service Book, but if an employee is reduced to
a lower substantive post, the reason of the reduction must be briefly shown.

146.     It is the duty of every employee to see that the Service Book is properly

maintained as prescribed in Rules 143 and 144 in order that there may be

no difficulty in verifying his service for pension.  The Head of the Office

should therefore permit an employee to examine his Service Book should

copy of blank Service Book at his cost.  On production of the book,

the Head of Office will make available to him his original Service

all official purposes.  It is only when the original is lost that reliance

will  be  placed  on  the  entries  in  the  duplicate.    Even  in  such

contingency, doubtful entries will be verified to the extent possible

with reference to relevant records.  A note to this effect will be

the employee concerned to the effect that he agrees to refund any

over-payment of pay / pension, etc., found to have been made on

the basis of entries in the duplicate Service Book.

                   Instruction to be observed by the Medical Board

preparing  the  Report

 1.            The Medical Board before recording their opinion should invariably consult

the proceedings of the previous Medical Boards, if any, as also all previous
medical documents connected with the Government employee before them

for examination.

 2.        If the injuries be more than one they should be numbered and described

separately, and should it be considered that, for instance though only ‘severe’

or slight in themselves, they represent together the equivalent of a single

“very  severe”  injury  such  an  opinion  may  be  expressed  in  the  columns

provided.

 3.       In answering the question in the prescribed form the Medical Board will

continue itself exclusively to the Medical aspect of the case and will carefully

discriminate between the Government employee’s unsupported statements

and the medical and documentary evidence available.

 4.         The Board will not express any opinion either to the Government employee

examined, or in their report, as to whether he is entitled to compensation, or

as to the amount of it, nor will it inform the Government employee how the

injury has been classified.
