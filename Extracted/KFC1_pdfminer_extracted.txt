6.              The detailed rules governing the demand and collection of  revenue under

the  control  of  the  various  departments  are  contained  in  the  respective

departmental  manuals,  or  in  the  orders  of  Government  on  the  subject

issued from time to time.

Remittance

7. (1)     When money is received on account of Government dues, a receipt for the sum

received should be given so that the counterfoils of the receipt book should

always show the details of revenue realised.

10

     (2)       The daily collection of each officer should be remitted into the Treasury, the

next working day.  When this is not possible owing to distance from the

Treasury, or any other cause, the money should be remitted periodically, i.e.,

at  least  once  in  a  week  on  the  last  working  day.  Officers  having  large

collections  may,  however,  make  more  than  one  remittance  in  a  week,
provided the amount of each such remittance is not less than  ` 500. The last
remittance for the month including the last receipt should, however, reach

the Treasury in the same month.

    (3)   The officer immediately responsible for the collection should keep the

receipts (chalans) for the amounts paid into the Treasury in proper files.

    [ ART.  8

       (3)   He should check the accounts as frequently as possible in order to see that
there  is  no  occasion  to  commit  fraud,  misappropriation  or  any  other

irregularity.

       (4)   He will be held personally responsible for any loss that may be found to be

due to any neglect of the duties laid upon him by the provisions of this Code

and other Codes or Financial Procedure issued by the Government (See also

Chapter XI ).

      (5)  The fact that a Government servant has been misled or deceived will, in no

way, mitigate his personal responsibility since every Government servant

should be familiar with the financial rules laid down by the Government.

     (6)  He should exercise a specially strict and close control in regard to the

maintenance of proper accounts.

        (7)    In preparing  the departmental accounts particular attention should be given

to the following points:—

   (i)     The departmental revenue accounts should not be compiled from

the returns prepared by the Treasury. But the Treasury Officer may

be  required,  where  necessary,  to  verify  the  returns  prepared  for

submission to the departmental controlling authority.

    (ii)      In  order  to  facilitate  check  by  Controlling  Officers  and  to  prevent

misclassification in the treasury accounts, all receipts of revenue should

be noted in the departmental accounts before being credited into the

treasury,  and  the  fact  noted  in  the  chalan. The  chalan  should  show

distinctly on what account the money is to be received and under what

11

detailed  head  of  revenue  it  has  been  entered  in  the  departmental
accounts.  The  entry  in  the  departmental  accounts  should  be

completed  before  the  amount  is  credited  into  the  treasury;  i.e.,  the

entry  in  the  departmental  accounts  should  show  the  amount  as

received.

      [ ART.  8

             Details of remittance towards loans and advances should be entered in
a separate register at the time of countersigning such chalans. If the
countersigning  officers  are  not  themselves  the  District  Controlling
Officers,  they  should  send  monthly  extracts  of  this  register  to  the
District  Controlling  Officers.  With  the  assistance  of  such  extracts
received from the subordinate officers and the register maintained in
their  own  offices,  the  District  Officers  should  verify  their  monthly
statements with the treasury figures at the time of reconciliation and see
whether money as per all the chalans countersigned by them or by their
subordinate officers has actually been remitted and if so note the number
and date of each chalan against the entry in their register and in the
extracts  received  from  subordinate  officers  and  delete  the  entries  in
respect of those countersigned chalans which had not been         presented
in the Treasury for remittance.

12

(iii)        Revenue  collected  in  one  district  on  account  of  another  should  be
credited  in  the  treasury  account  of  the  receiving  district  under  the
appropriate head of account and the fact intimated to the appropriate
departmental  officer  in  the  district  concerned. Any  such  item  of
revenue  should  be  omitted  in  the  demand,  collection  and  balance
statement of the receiving district and included in that of the district to
which  it  belongs.  Foot  notes  should  be  added  to  the  demand,
collection and balance statements of both the districts to explain the
difference between these statements and the treasury accounts.

(iv)        The  departmental  sub  controlling  officers  should  reconcile  the
departmental  figures  with  the  treasury  figures  and  obtain  the
signature of the Treasury Officer on  the statement prepared by them in
token of the agreement of their figures with the treasury figures, before
the accounts are submitted to the Controlling Officers. This should be
done through the departmental staff deputed to the treasuries for the
reconciliation work as required in para 68 of the Budget Manual.

                   Duties of  the Departmental Controlling Officer in

Respect  of  Maintenance of  Accounts

9.        Every  Departmental  Controlling  Officer  should.—  (1)  Obtain  regular

accounts and returns from his subordinates for the amounts realised by

them and paid into the Treasury and consolidate the figures in a register.

The  total  receipts  for  each  month  should  be  classified  in  the  Register

according to the heads of account in the budget estimate.

      (2)      Compare the figures compiled in this Register with the accounts received

from the Accountant General and reconcile any differences as early as

possible in communication with the Treasury Officers concerned and if

necessary with the Accountant General also.

      (3)    See that the reconciliation of the figures for March is completed as early as

possible since corrections, if any, that may be required in the Accountant

General’s books have to be made before the accounts of the year are closed.

        (4)    Inform  the  Accountant  General  at  once,  of  any  wrong  credit,  when

discovered,  in  order  that  the  accounts  may  be  corrected.  When  a
subordinate Government servant’s return includes a credit for which there is

no  corresponding  credit  in  the  accounts  received  from  the Accountant

General, the Controlling Officer should, in the first instance, call for full

information from the subordinate Government servant.

      (5)     Exercise a close watch in regard to the reconciliation work of receipt figures

as in the case of expenditure. For this, the Chief Controlling Officers should

13

get quarterly reports on the progress of reconciliation work in respect of
departmental  receipts  from  their  subordinate  controlling  officers  with  a
certificate to the effect that the departmental figures have been reconciled
with those booked in the Treasury. The Controlling Officers should review
the reports received from the subordinate controlling officers and satisfy
themselves that the reconciliation of departmental receipt figures is done
properly  and  promptly.  The  Chief  Controlling  Officers  should  furnish  a

on 30th September and 31st March every year.

............................................(here specify the head of account) hereby certify
that the departmental figures of receipts for the period upto .............................
........................... have been reconciled with those booked in the  Treasury.

           Duties of  the  Inspecting  Officers  in Checking  Revenue Collection

14

10. (1)  The Inspecting Officers will compare the entries in the counterfoils in the
printed counterfoil receipts book with those in the register of collections and
with any original receipt they may be able to obtain from the persons to
whom they were issued.

        (2)    They will check the totals in the Register of collections and will see that the
amount shown as collected agrees with the total of the amounts paid into the
Treasury as shown in the chalan and the cash in the hands of the      Government
servant.

     (3)  The comparison will be made from the time of the last inspection and the
accounts should be inspected on the spot at least once every year.

        Note:–  The  selection  of  Inspecting  Officers  rests  with  the  Heads  of
Departments  and  District  Officers  as  the  case  may  be.  Inspecting
Officers should be sent to inspect the accounts periodically. Heads of
Departments  and  District  Officers  should  themselves  inspect  the
accounts at regular intervals. When doing so, they should check the
collection register in part by comparison with the counterfoil receipts
and should see that the total of the Register of Receipts agrees with the
total  of  chalans  and  the  balance  in  hand.  In  many  cases,  items  for
realisation vary especially when they are the subject of sale by auctions.
The Officer-in-charge should therefore, keep the orders sanctioning
sale in proper file, and the Inspecting Officer should check the register
with them to see that the proper amounts have been entered.

          The responsibility for recovering rent in respect of  the first category of

buildings which are used wholly or partially as residences rest mainly on the

Executive Engineer of the Division in which the building is located. But the

Head of the office in which the tenant is employed and the Treasury Officer

or other Officer who disburses his pay also bear some responsibility in the

matter. In respect of the second category of  buildings, the responsibility

rests mainly on the departmental officers concerned.

the Head of the office to intimate every subsequent month, only the changes,

if any, in the completed statement, but when there is no change he should
inform the Executive Engineer of that fact. If a building is vacant, the Head of

the Office concerned should state the period for which he expects it to be

vacant  and  say  whether  it  will  be  required  during  that  period  by  any

Government servant of the same department.

refer  any  points  raised  by  them  to  the  Drawing  Officer/Executive

Engineer.

   (i)       if the Government servant is paid up to the date of making overcharge,

recover from the pay bill the rent due up to that date; or

    (ii)      if  the  Government  servant  is  not  paid  up  to  the  date  of  making

overcharge, recover from any pay bill which is paid, the rent due for

the period covered by the pay bill and not on the  reverse of the last

pay certificate the balance of rent due for recovery on account of the

remaining period up to the date of making over charge.

16.           The Treasury Officer should compare the total of the recoveries shown in the

copies  of  the  demand  statement  of  rents  attached  to  the  pay  bills  (which

should include recoveries made too late for inclusion in the copy returned to

adjusted as soon as possible after the orders are issued, by a reduction
in the assessment for a subsequent month or if this is impracticable or
inconvenient by repayment in cash.

19.      The Accountant General will select a few Treasuries each month and will
forward  to  the  Executive  Engineer  concerned  the  copies  of  the  demand
statement  of  rents  in  Form  I  (B)  received  by  him  during  the  month  for
verification with the Treasury accounts. The Divisional Accountant should
compare these statements with the corresponding entries in the Register of
Rents  of  Buildings  and  Lands,  see  that  the Accountant  General  has  not
omitted to send any statement pertaining to the treasuries concerned and
take steps to revise the assessments of rents due from Government Officers
in  respect  of  whom  the  Accountant  General  has  altered  the  rate  of
emoluments entered in the statements.

                     Rents of  Government  Buildings,  Lands, etc., due  from

Private  Persons and  Pensioners

be hired for public purposes with the sanction of Government, the rent being
paid by the public office or department occupying it. When the building is
entirely used for office accommodation, the rent is wholly chargeable to
Government, while when it is partly used for office purposes, and partly for
residential      purposes, the share of the rent payable by Government will be
proportionate to the amount of the main building set aside solely for office
use not exceeding half the rent of the house. The Municipal tax assessed on
the annual value of     buildings in which the accommodation is provided, or
on the land appertaining to them, should be paid by the owner.

      Note:–  Rents  recovered  from  officers  sharing  office-cum-residential
accommodation in private buildings will be classified as receipts of the
departments concerned.

Rent of Hostels

22.        When a hostel is provided for a Government Educational Institution, the

departmental authority in charge of the institution should immediately after

taking charge of the hostel building request the Head of the Department to

obtain the Government’s orders for the fixation and recovery of rent. Such

hostels should be included in the departmental authorities’ returns in Form 1

22

(A) and in the monthly returns of residential buildings sent to the Accountant

General by the Executive Engineers concerned (See Note under Article 13).

      Note  1:–  Warden’s  quarters  attached  to  hostels  come  under  the  class  of

residences for Government Officials and should be shown in the monthly

return whether any rent is recovered or not.

     Note 2:– When an electric installation is  provided for a hostel, the room rent

should be raised so as to cover the cost of  the installation and meter

hire. The actual cost of the electric energy consumed and of repairs to

electrical fittings should be recovered evenly from the students living in

the hostel each month*

       FINES

        Duties of  Government Officers in the Realisation of  Fines

23. (a)    It is the duty of every Court or authority having the power to fine to see that

the fines are correctly realised and the receipts are properly checked and that

the  money  received  reaches  the  Treasury  without  delay.  Adequate

precautions should be taken to see that there are no double refunds of fines

or refunds of fines not actually paid into the Treasury.

   [ ARTS.  22-23

               Each Court, Civil or Criminal, should submit to the District Judge or the District
Magistrate, as the case may be, a monthly statement in Form 2 showing the

demand, collection and balance of fines levied and written off by it and the

amounts refunded in respect of fines. This statement should reach the District

Judge  or the District Magistrate  during the first week of the succeeding calendar

month. The statement should exhibit the amounts under each head of account,

e.g., magisterial fines, fines under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act,

Motor Vehicles Act, etc., separately.

           The District Judge  or the District Magistrate, as the case may be, should

each consolidate the returns so received into a monthly fines statement for

the Courts under him. This monthly statement should then be forwarded to

the Treasury Officer as soon as possible. They should review the monthly

progress made in the collection of fines and take immediate and effective

steps for the realisation of the balance, if any.

                The Treasury Officer should verify the amounts shown as remitted into the
Treasury in the monthly statement of fines received from the District Judge
or  the  District  Magistrate,  with  the  credit  appearing  in  the  Treasury
accounts  and  if  found  correct,  he  should  certify  as  to  the  correctness  of
these  amounts.  If  there  is  any  discrepancy  between  the  consolidated
statement  and  the  treasury  account,  the  Treasury  Officer  may  get  the
discrepancy cleared, before giving a certificate if necessary by referring the
matter to the District Judge or the District Magistrate, as the case may be.

                              The Procedure to be adopted when any amount is realised

in any  District  on account of a fine imposed in
another District of the State.

23

        (b)    When any amount is realised in any district on account of a fine imposed in
another district of the State, the amount should not be remitted to the Court
which inflicted the fine but should be treated, for the purpose of the fines
statements, as if a fine equal to the amount realised had been inflicted by the
Court in which it is realised. The Court which realises the amount should

sent  an  advice  of  the  recovery  to  the  court  which  inflicted  the  fine  and

should also make a note of the Court to which the amount relates against the

credit in its Fines Register and monthly statement. The Court which inflicted

the fine should, on receiving the intimation, note in its Fines Register and

monthly statement the amount of the recovery so advised and the name of

the treasury into which the amount was paid.

           The Procedure for keeping Accounts Relating to Fines

24.      Each Court should maintain two remittance books: one with the heading

24

“Courts  of  Law”  and  the  other  with  the  heading  “Stamps”. All  stamp

penalties,  deficient  stamp  duty,  etc.,  should  be  brought  to  the  remittance

book under Stamps and all fees and fines, Civil or Criminal and other items

belonging to Courts realised by Courts should be entered in the remittance

book under Courts of Law. Particulars of the date of remittance, nature of

item, amount, etc., should be clearly noted in the books.  The books will be

signed by the head ministerial officer and the Judge or Magistrate in the

proper columns, and sent with the money to the Treasury along with the

chalans on the day of realisation, to be credited under the proper head. The

Treasurer  and  the  Treasury  Officer  will  sign  in  the  proper  columns    and

return the books. At the end of the month, the entries will be totalled by the

head ministerial officer and submitted to the Treasury, where the totals will

be checked with the Treasury accounts and signed by the Treasurer and the

Treasury Officer, if correct.

   Note:– The annual cash balance statements of Civil Courts and the half-

yearly fines statements of Criminal Courts will be got certified by the

Treasuries before  submission to the High Court. To enable the treasuries

to furnish these certificates, the Courts will furnish them with particulars

of remittance (copy of Remittance Register relating to the period).

authorities concerned.

                As a general rule, publications should be priced on a costing system and the

sale price should be fixed at 50 per cent above the cost price in order to cover

the commission on sale, etc., and storage and distribution. The cost is arrived

at as below:-

     (a)   Cost of labour on composing, printing, binding, etc., plus.

          (b)    Cost  of  non-productive  and  non-effective  charges  based  on  an

average  of  the  past  year,  viz.,  supervision,  contingencies,  taxes,

depreciation  of  plant,  cost  of  miscellaneous  raw  materials,  glue,

printing ink, etc., and power, plus.

25

       (c)   Cost of paper and binding materials.

               To these, 50 per cent is added on account of selling commission, etc., and

the  total is divided by the number of  copies printed to arrive at the sale price

of each copy.

rendered  by  Government  on  account  of    local  bodies  or  other  private  or

public  bodies  and  persons,  e.g.,  estates  private  enterprises  and  private

               In the case of local funds, Government may in exceptional cases authorise

one of the following arrangements: —

     (i)      Payments as made by Government may be charged to the balance of the

deposits of the local fund in Government books.

      (ii)       Recoveries from the local fund may be postponed till the time when

Government has to make payment for the charges.

     (iii)     Payments may be made as advances from Government funds in the

first instance pending recovery from the local fund either in cash or

by adjustment against its account with the treasury.

Note:– The following are some of the more common cases in which charges

are incurred for services rendered by Government on account of local

bodies and others, subject to recoveries being made under the orders

governing each case:–

Medical subordinates lent to local bodies;

Management of court of wards;

Estate  surveys;

Municipal town surveys;

Works connected with laying down regular lines of street in Municipalities;

 Police guards supplied to private parties;

Acquisition of land for local bodies and railways;

Establishment for appraisement, etc., of produce in proprietary estates.

33. (a)      Amounts due to Government from local bodies including overdue instalments

on account of repayment of loan taken by them, shall be subject to recovery

by  adjustment  from  the  grant-in-aid  (other  than  those  payable  under  the

provisions of a statute) sanctioned for payment to them.

                      Procedure for the Recovery of Arrears due to

Government from Local Bodies

29

All local bodies to whom non-statutory grants-in-aid are payable should
furnish a statement showing the amounts due to Government and remaining
unpaid by the local body concerned, to the officer disbursing the grants.
The disbursing officer should credit to Government the amounts so shown
as  outstanding,  out  of  the  Government  grant  and  will  disburse  only  the
balance of the grant, if any, remaining after such adjustment. The accounts
should be so prepared as to show the entire Government grant as disbursed
to  the  local  body  concerned  partly  in  cash  and  partly  in  adjustment  in
satisfaction of Government claims.

     (b)     In respect of supplies made or services rendered by service departments to

local bodies, etc. (e.g., value of medicine supplied from the Medical Stores,

value of vaccine-lymph supplied from the Public Health Laboratory, cost of

stationery supplied from the Stationery Department, cost of printed forms

supplied  from  the  Forms  Stores,  value  of  printing  work  done  at  the

Government Presses) the departmental officer concerned should see that the

value  thereof  is  recovered  and  remitted  to  treasuries  promptly.  For  such

supplies and services, bills containing full details of the transactions (e.g.,

particulars of work done or supplies made, institution to which the bill     relates,

30

etc.), should be sent by the concerned officers promptly. These bills should

be numbered serially and a record of bills sent out should be maintained in

Form 3. The receipt of replies from the offices concerned should be watched

and necessary action taken in cases of delay. A copy of this register, i.e., a

statement showing the bills sent out during the month  (with columns of

recoveries left blank) will be sent to the Audit Office by the 5th of the next

month to note the claims preferred and for taking action in cases of delayed

payments.

Miscellaneous Dues and Special Recoveries

34.          The Accountant General maintains a register of special recoveries in which he

enters miscellaneous amounts due to the Government but not forming part

of the ordinary revenues regularly administrated by the Government, e.g.,

contributions  for  leave  and  pensions  of  officers  lent  to  foreign  service,

contributions from Municipalities, contractors and others towards the cost

of establishment entertained by the Government, Periyar lease money, etc.

He watches that these amounts are duly realised and reports any default at

once to the Government.

Refunds of Revenue

35.         The powers of officers to sanction refunds of revenue are contained in the

Book of Financial Powers and are subject further to the administrative orders

30

  CHAPTER II ]

RECEIPTS,  COLLECTION   AND   CHECK

 [ ARTS.  35-36

of Government issued from time to time and embodied in the Departmental

Manuals and Standing Orders. In respect of cases not provided for in the

Book of Financial Powers, the sanction of Government is necessary.

36.           On receipt of an application for refund in respect of any item of revenue, the

officer who has brought to account that particular item of revenue should:

      (1)    Trace out the original records relating to the receipt of the amount

in  question.

      (2)    Verify the claim with reference to the original records.

      (3)      See whether the application is received within the maximum time limits

allowed under the rules.

      (4)     Obtain sanction for the refund from competent authority in case he is

not himself competent to sanction the refund in question.

    (5)    After satisfying himself that the refund in question is admissible

under  the  rules,  prepare  the  refund  order  and  if  he  is  himself

competent to sanction the refund, he may either record his sanction
on the voucher itself or record it  separately, giving a reference to it

on the voucher and attaching a certified copy. If sanction is obtained

from a higher authority, the latter procedure should be followed.

      (6)     See that the particulars of the refund are recorded against the original

entry of the receipt in the departmental accounts, in such a way as to

make it impossible to entertain by mistake any further claim for a refund

of the same amount.

31

     (7)    Record the particulars of the refund on the counterfoil of the receipt

previously  granted  to  the  payer  and  that  receipt  (and  any  other

acknowledgment  granted  to  the  payer)  should  if  possible  be  taken

back and destroyed.

      (8)     Pay the amount to the person entitled to receive it, in accordance with

the rules governing each particular class of  refund, or prepare a proper

voucher  payable  to  that  person  for  presentation  at  the  Treasury  for

payment.

            Time Limits for Claim for Refunds of Revenue

37.    Refunds of revenue may be classified as follows:—

        (a)  refunds of revenue which are made ex gratia although the Government are

under no legal obligation to make them; and

32

        (b)  refunds of revenue to which the claimants are legally entitled.

                An application for a refund of revenue to be sanctioned ex gratia should be

rejected if it is received after one year from the date of credit of the revenue

to the Government.

            In cases where a notice has been issued to the party, the application for such

refund of revenue may be rejected, if it is received after 3 months from the date of

receipt of the notice by the party.

   Note 1:–These limits are merely maximum time limits and no application for

an ex gratia refund should be entertained unless it is received within

the maximum time allowed. This does not mean that all applications for

such refunds received within the maximum time limits applicable should

necessarily be granted. If the authority competent to sanction                        ex

gratia refunds of a particular kind considers that for special         reasons,

a shorter time limit should be enforced in practice in regard to them, this

should be done.

    Note  2:–A  refund  of  revenue  of  the  kind  mentioned  in  clause  (b)  above

should be sanctioned on application provided the claim is not barred

by limitation under the Indian Limitation  Act, 1908 (India  Act, IX of

1908) or any other law or rule having the force of law.

of the Official Trustees Act, 1913 (India Act II of 1913) since they
are governed by the relevant Acts;

(iii)        Refunds  of  court  fees  regulated  by  the  Court  Fees Act,  which

sanctioned during the preceding financial year by competent authorities in

exercise of the discretionary powers vested in them otherwise than by law or

rule having the force of law.

           The remissions of revenue included in the statement should be classified

broadly with reference to the reasons for sanctioning them. The Head of a

Department  may  prescribe  for  the  guidance  of  the  Government  officers

subordinate to him a broad classification for this purpose suited to the items

34

of revenue collected by them. The statement should show the total amount

remitted  under  each  class  of  remissions  and  should  include  a  brief

explanation of the circumstances leading to the total remission under each

class.

Waiver of Revenue

38A.      Waiver of  revenue is the forsaking of recovery of  overpayments and other

similar claims without exploring all possible means of recovery.

GENERAL  PRINCIPLES  AND  RULES

General Principles

40. (a)     No Government servant may incur any item of expenditure from public funds

unless the following two conditions are satisfied :

  (i)     The expenditure must have been sanctioned by a general or special

order of the authority competent to sanction such expenditure; and

  (ii)     Sufficient funds must have been provided for the expenditure in the

Appropriation  Act(s)  for  the  current  financial  year  or  by  a

re-appropriation of funds sanctioned by a competent authority or by

an advance from the Contingency Fund.

                The two conditions are independent and both the conditions should be

satisfied before any expenditure is incurred from general revenues.

                    No  authority  subordinate  to  the  Government  should  sanction  any
expenditure unless sufficient funds have already been provided for

the purpose subject to the exceptions specified in items 1,3 and 5 of

clause (c) below:

Standards of Financial Propriety

     (b)  Every Government servant who incurs or authorises the incurring of any

expenditure from public funds should see that it does not contravene the

following principles which are known as the standards of financial propriety.

35

       (1) The expenditure should not be prima facie more than the occasion

demands.  Every Government servant is expected to exercise the same

diligence and care in respect of all expenditure from public moneys

under his control as a person of ordinary prudence would exercise in

respect of the expenditure of his own money.

35

                                      THE  KERALA  FINANCIAL CODE  VOL  I
 CHAPTER III ]

  [ ART.  40

      (2)  A Government servant should not exercise his powers of sanctioning

expenditure  so  as  to  pass  an  order  directly  or  indirectly  to  his  own

advantage.

      (3)  Public moneys should not be utilised for the benefit of a particular

person or section of the community unless:

    (i)      The expenditure involved is  ` 100 or less.

    (ii)      A claim for the amount would be enforced in a Court of  Law or

    (iii)    The expenditure is in pursuance of a recognized policy or custom.

36

             Important Financial Principles

    (c)     It should be clearly understood that—

    (1)     money indisputably payable by Government at one time or other (i.e.,

inevitable payments) should not, as far as possible, be left unpaid.

     (2)      money paid should under no circumstances be kept out of accounts a

day longer than is absolutely necessary even though the payment is

not  covered by proper sanction.

      (3)      inevitable payments should not be postponed even for the purpose

of avoiding an excess over a grant or appropriation.

     (4)     all actual liabilities should be ascertained, liquidated and payment

recorded at the earliest possible date.

     (5)       a disbursing officer may not  on his own authority authorise any payment
in excess of the funds placed at his disposal. But absence of funds should
not  necessarily  prevent  the  payments  of  any  sums  really  due  by
Government. If the disbursing officer is called upon to honour   a claim
which is certain to produce an excess over the allotment or appropriation
at  his  disposal,  he  should  take  the  orders  of  the  administrative
authority to which he is subordinate before authorising payment of
the claim in question.

36

CHAPTER III ]

EXPENDITURE

        [ ARTS.  40-42

     (6)     all appropriations lapse at the close of the financial year.

       (7)     a Government servant should not, on any account, reserve or appropriate

by transfer to a deposit or any other head or draw from the treasury and

keep in a cash chest, any portion of an  appropriation remaining unexpended

during the year in order to prevent it from lapsing and use it for expenditure

after the end of the year. No attempt should be made to prevent the lapse

of an appropriation by any undue rush of expenditure during March.

      (8)     the amount of any allowance, such as travelling allowance, granted to

meet expenditure of a particular type, should be so regulated that it is

not on the whole a source of profit to the recipient.

      (9)      when any authority accords sanction for expenditure of a definite amount

or upto a specified maximum limit, the amount should always be expressed

both in words and figures.

      (10)    it is the duty of every Government servant not merely to observe complete

integrity in financial matters but also to be constantly watchful to see that

the best possible value is obtained for all public funds spend by him or
under his control and to guard scrupulously against every kind of wasteful

expenditure from public funds.

41.           The Budget Manual contains the rules regarding the preparation, examination

and  consolidation  of  the  budget  estimates,  their  passage  through  the

Legislature,  the  distribution  of  appropriations  among  controlling  and

disbursing  officers,  the  responsibility  of  these  officers  for  watching  the

progress  of  expenditure  and  ensuring  that  it  does  not  exceed  the

37

appropriations,  the authorities competent to sanction re-appropriation and

the  procedure for obtaining supplementary appropriations.

42.         The Government have power to incur any expenditure provided that it does
not contravene the provisions of the Constitution of India or any Law or any
Rules made under any one of them and subject to the limitations mentioned
in Article 68 in regard to certain posts.

      [ ARTS.  43-44

43.        An authority subordinate to the Government may sanction expenditure or

advances from public moneys in those cases only in which it is authorised to

do so by—

   (i)       the provisions of any legislative enactment for the time being in force

or of rules made under any such enactment; or

   (ii)     the rules in this Code or any other Code or Manual issued by or with the

approval of Government; or

   (iii)      an order of the Government delegating to it powers to incur expenditure

38

of a specified kind.

                Nothing contained in this article shall empower any subordinate authority

to  sanction,  except  when  the  Government  have  expressly  accorded  their

previous sanction in each case, any expenditure involving the introduction

of a new principle or practice.

44. (a)    In every application for sanction  to fresh expenditure it should be distinctly

stated whether provision for the proposed expenditure has been made in the

budget appropriations for the year, and if such provision has not been made

whether sufficient funds can be found by re-appropriation in case the fresh

expenditure involved is not on a ‘New Service’ (See Article 42).

       (b)  Authorities which sanction new expenditure after funds have been

appropriation.

                    Where  it  is  desired  to  sanction  expenditure  before  funds  have  been

communicated, as may be necessary in order to avoid delay in starting

work at the beginning of a new financial year or to prevent duplication of
orders, the authority which does so should be careful to add the words

“subject to funds being communicated in the budget of the year”.

     Note :– Vague expression such as “subject to budget provision” should be

carefully avoided in conveying sanctions to expenditure.

38

CHAPTER III ]

EXPENDITURE

          [ ART.  45

Communication of Sanction

45.           A copy of every order sanctioning expenditure should be communicated
to the Accountant General by the authority which accords sanction. If
the sanctioning authority is the Government, except in cases where power
may have been delegated to Departments under rules approved by the
Finance Department and in cases where the specific concurrence of the
Finance Department has been given [* two copies of the sanctions should
be forwarded to the Accountant General, one signed in ink and the other
unsigned,  prominently  marked  ‘Duplicate-Not  for  payment’.The
duplicate  copy  should  be  sent  to  the Accountant  General  by  name  in
separate cover]. In cases where the specific concurrence of the Finance
Department has been given that fact should be specific in the address
entry of the order sanctioning the expenditure.

               When the Head of a Department or any other subordinate authority issues
an order sanctioning expenditure either the sanctioning authority itself or a
Gazetted Government servant working in the office of that authority should
ordinarily  communicate  the  order  to  the Accountant  General. When  this
procedure  would  cause  inconvenience,  sanctions  may  be  communicated
over the signature of the non- gazetted Government servant who is the Head
Ministerial Officer of the Office, provided that this arrangement is intimated
beforehand to the Accountant General by the sanctioning authority.

   Note 1:– Financial sanctions communicated to audit should invariably
be  signed  in  ink  by  the  sanctioning  authority  or  other  officers
authorised  for  the  purpose.  No  action  will  be  taken  in  audit  on
copies of financial sanctions issued over facimile and cyclostyled
signatures of sanctioning authorities or other authorised officers.

Advance and Advance for the purchase of a Motor Car/Motor Cycle/
Scooter) need not be forwarded to the Accountant General.

46.          An order sanctioning an addition to the pay of any Government servant

should  state  briefly  the  reasons  for  granting  it,  so  as  to  enable  the

Accountant  General  to  verify  that  its  classification  as  special  pay  or

compensatory allowance, as the case may be, is correct. Whenever, as in

this  instance,  a  rule  requires  that  the  reasons  for  granting  any

concession or allowance be mentioned in the order sanctioning it, if it is

considered undesirable to mention the reasons in the official order, the

40

sanctioning  authority  should  communicate  them  confidentially  to  the

Accountant General.

47.          Every order sanctioning a grant of land or alienation of land revenue, other

than  an  assignment  of  land  revenue,  which  is  treated  as  a  cash  payment

should  be  communicated  to  the  Accountant  General  with  the  details

necessary to enable him to audit the sanction accorded.

48.       Any authority which passes an order affecting the personal emoluments,
posting,  leave,  etc.,  of  any  Gazetted  Government  servant  should
communicate a copy to the Accountant General; but when any such order is
notified in the Government Gazette a separate copy need not ordinarily be
sent to the Accountant General. An order of a special nature sanctioning   the
grant  to  a  non-gazetted  Government  servant  of  any  emoluments  in
addition to those admissible under the rules relating to the post which he
holds  or  ordering  the  discontinuance  of  any  such  additional  emoluments
previously sanctioned, should be communicated to the Accountant General.
Otherwise, it is not necessary to communicate to the Accountant General
orders  affecting  the  personal  emoluments  of  non-gazetted  Government
servants.  The  authorities  preparing  the  pay  bills  and  absentee  statements
concerned should include in them all the information required for auditing
the pay and allowances of non-gazetted Establishments and are responsible
for seeing that the orders of the competent authority are obtained in each
case as required by the rules.

Date of Effect of Sanction

49.          Statutory rules made by the Government which are required by the law to be
published  take  effect  from  the  date  on  which  they  are  published  in  the
manner,  if  any,  specified  in  the  relevant Act  or,  if  no  special  mode  of
publication is laid down, from the date on which they are published in the
Government Gazette. Statutory rules made by the State Government which
are not required by law to be published take effect from the date of the order
issuing the rules. A sanction of the Government or an authority subordinate
to the Government takes effect from the date of the order conveying the
sanction.

                    Generally  concessions  such  as  revision  of  pay,  grant  of  compensatory
allowances and special pay, should not be given with retrospective effect.

              If, however, any such rules or orders themselves provide that they take effect

from a specified date, they take effect accordingly.

Lapse of  Sanction

50.          A  sanction for any fresh charge shall, unless it is specially renewed, lapse if
no payment in whole or in part has been made during a period of twelve
months from the date of issue of the sanction, provided that :

        (i)      When  the  period  of  currency  of  the  sanction  is  prescribed  in  the
departmental regulations or is specified in the sanction itself, it shall
lapse on the expiry of such period; or

     (ii)   When there is specific provision  in a sanction that the expenditure
would be met from the budget provision of a specified financial year, it
shall lapse at the close of that financial year; or

41

       (iii)   In the  case of purchase of stores, a sanction shall not  lapse if tenders
have been accepted (in the case of local or direct purchase of stores)
or indents have been placed (in the case of central purchases)  on the
central  purchase  organisation,  within  the  period  of  one  year  of  the

date of issue of sanction, even if the actual payment in whole or in part
has not been made during the said period.

        In cases, excepting those mentioned in clause (ii) above in which
payment  in part has been made within a period of twelve months
from the date of issue of the sanction, the subsequent payment of
the balance may  subject to the existence of  budget provision, be
made  without  a  fresh  expenditure  sanction.  The  bill  for  the
subsequent  payment,  besides  containing  a    reference  to  the
expenditure sanction, should also contain a reference to the number
and date of the voucher under which the first payment was made.

          Note:– The above rules does not apply to-

         (i)    the sanction for an allowance granted to the holders of a post or a
class  of  posts  subject  to  certain  conditions  but  not  drawn  by  a
particular  incumbent or incumbents because the conditions are not
fulfilled.

       (ii)    the sanction of a competent authority for additions to be made

51.       Government servant who incurs expenditure on behalf of the Government
may  have to enter into a contract with a private firm or a contractor for the
supply of stores or for the execution of a work. The Government also some
times employ a person on contract to serve as an officer under them for a
definite period. No contracts may be entered into by any authority which has
not been empowered to do so. All contracts should be in the form of written
agreements  expressed  to  be  made  by  the  Governor  and  signed  by  the
competent authority. Contracts regarding which there are no definite rules or
orders of Government as to conditions, forms, etc., should be entered into
only after obtaining the sanction of Government.

  [ ART.  51

           Whenever a contract is made by or on behalf of the Government, the

following general principles should be observed :-

   (i)       The terms of the contract should be precise and definite and there should

be no room for ambiguity or misconstruction of any of its provisions;

  (ii)    Before finally entering into a contract on behalf of Government, the
Government servant concerned should take legal and financial advice
except in those particular cases or classes of cases in regard to which
the departmental codes or the Government orders issued from time to
time contain clear and complete instructions ;

   (iii)     Contracts  for the supply of stores or the execution of works should be
made  as  far  as  possible  only  after  openly  inviting  and  receiving

tenders from all who wish to tender,  and in cases in which the lowest

tender is not accepted, reasons should be recorded;

   (iv)    In selecting the tender to be accepted, the financial status of the

individuals and firms tendering must be taken into consideration

in addition to all other relevant factors;

   (v)     The terms of a contract once entered into should not be materially varied

without  the  previous  consent  of  the  Government  or  the  authority

competent to enter into the contract as so varied;

   (vi)      Standard forms of contracts should be used in all cases for which they

have been prescribed, and the rates mentioned in the contract should

be  subject to adequate prior scrutiny;

  (vii)      When a contract is likely to endure for a period of more than five years,

43

it should, wherever feasible include a provision for an unconditional

power of revocation or cancellation by Government at any time on the
expiry of six months notice to that effect; and

  (viii)  Whenever it is likely that a contractor will be entrusted with any

Government property in connection with his contract, a provision

  [ ARTS.  51-52

should  be  inserted  in  the  contract  safeguarding  the  Government
against loss or damage in respect of any Government property that
may be entrusted to him or his servants.

(ix)     The Government servant who enters into a contract on behalf of
Government and also his subordinates are responsible for strictly
enforcing  the  terms  of  the  contract  and  for  seeing  that  no  act  is
done that would tend to nullify or vitiate the contract.

44

                The authorities empowered to enter into contract on behalf of the Governor
are specified in the Book of Financial Powers.  All contracts in regard to
which the Government have not issued any definite rules or orders as to
conditions, forms, etc., and all contracts containing unusual conditions or
involving  any  uncertain  or  indefinite  liability  should  only  be  made  after
obtaining  the  special  sanction  of  the  Government,  who  will  obtain  the
necessary legal and financial advice in each case. Whenever it is proposed
for special and exceptional reasons to agree to any material variation in the
terms of an existing contract made on behalf of the Government, the matter
should be referred to the Government for orders.

Arrear Claims

*52.          Heads  of  Offices  and  Departments  should  distinctly  understand  that  the
personal claims of officers accruing under the orders of competent authority
should, to avoid undeserved hardship, be discharged with the least delay
possible  and  that  the  provisions  for  the  entertainment  of  belated  claims
made in Articles 53 and 55 below are intended for exceptional cases and
where, for unavoidable causes,  the speedy settlement of claims is rendered
impossible. Every cases of a deferred claim submitted for the sanction of the
Head of a Department or the Government, should invariably be accompanied
by a clear explanation of the necessity for postponing the settlement of the
claim, and where the postponement was avoidable, also by a report of the
names of officers responsible for the delay and of the action taken to prevent
the recurrence of such cases.

not arise until the order is issued and should not therefore be treated as a

claim allowed to remain in abeyance during the period prior to the date of the

order.

            (3)   Pay and allowances, leave salary and other monthly recurring  payments

to Government servants become due for payment on expiry of the month

for  these  recurring  payments  are  accorded  post-facto  they  should  be

held to have become due for payment on the date of sanction.

         (9)      For the purpose of the rules regarding sanction from the Head of the
Department the date on which a claim is presented at the treasury or

other office of disbursement should be considered to be the date on

which it is preferred.

   (c)    Claims by local bodies should be preferred within the dates specified for

payment, or when no dates are specified, before the close of the financial

year in which they fall due, or within six months from the dates on which

they fall due, whichever is earlier. In cases where the claims are not made in

accordance with the above rules, the payments will not be made unless the

specific sanction of Government is obtained.

    Note:– The ‘date on which the claims fall due’ means date of receipt by the

local body concerned of the orders of the Government authorising the

local bodies to draw the grant.

      (d)     Under the provisions of Section 78-B of the Indian Railways Act, 1890 (9 of

1890), claims for a refund of an overcharge in respect of goods carried by a

railway or to compensation for the loss, destruction or deterioration of goods

delivered to it should be made to the railway administration within six months

from the date of the delivery of the goods for carriage by railway. All officers

and  subordinates  who  handle  railway  consignments  should  take  prompt

action  in  such  matters  and  failure  to  do  so  will  render  them  personally

responsible for any loss which Government may have to sustain by their

negligence.

      (e)        As a rule, the travelling allowance claims should be preferred within a month

of  the  due  date.  Controlling  officers  may  pass  for  payment  travelling

allowance claims presented more than a month after the due date, only if

there is sufficient justification for the delay. The travelling allowance drawn

submission of the final travelling allowance bill.  In such  cases, if the final

travelling allowance bill  is not preferred within three months of the due date,

the advance drawn should be recovered in lump from the next pay bill of the

officer concerned and settled finally. The right of a Government servant/

non-official member   serving on Government Committees, Commissions,

etc., to travelling allowance, including daily allowance, shall be forfeited or

deemed to have been relinquished if the claim for it is not preferred to the

*Note:– (i)  In cases where the adjustment bill is not submitted within the

prescribed time, the entire amount of advance   will be recovered in

prescribed at   (ii) below will be charged on the entire amount of advance

from the date of drawal to the date of recovery of the   amount.

arrears was due to official dilatoriness or delay, the period of limitation will

be counted from the date of completion of the official steps admitting the

claims. In such cases, the arrear claims can be paid only with the sanction of

          Arrear Claims Relating to Statutory Grants

58.           Arrear claims including those relating to Statutory Grants will be sanctioned

by Government when the claim is preferred within three years subsequent to

the year in which the payment was due. If the claim is preferred after that

52

period, it will be summarily rejected   by  Government except (a) when money

due to a local body has been credited to General Revenues by a mistake on

the part of a Government Officer and (b) when the local body concerned is in

a position to establish that it had no direct means of ascertaining earlier the

mistake, provided that the amount involved exceeds Rupee one.

Supply of Information to Audit

59.         It is the duty of every departmental and controlling officer to see that the
Accountant General is afforded all reasonable facilities in the   discharges of

his functions and furnished with the fullest possible information for which

he may ask for the preparation of any account or report which it is his duty to

prepare. No such information nor any books or other documents to which

the Comptroller and Auditor General has a statutory right of access may be

withheld from the Accountant General.

             According to the proviso to paragraph 18 of the Government of India

(Audit and Accounts) Order,1936, in the case of any document certified

as a secret document by the Governor, the Auditor General shall accept a
statement certified as  correct by the Governor as a correct statement of

the facts stated in that document. If in any file of the Secretariat there is

any  enunciation  of  Policy  by  any  Minister  or  any  statement  which  is

secret  not  intended  to  be  seen  by  others  the  Accountant  General  is

required to be satisfied with the certificate contemplated therein and has

no right to insist on having an inspection of it by him. Each case has to

be decided with reference to the particular facts in order to find out whether

the file contains any secret matter thus disentitling the Accountant General

to have an inspection of it.

     Overcharges and Audit Objections

60.       Every Government servant who draws bills for pay and allowances or

contingent expenses is primarily responsible for the correctness of the

amount for which each bill is drawn . If any amount is drawn in excess of

what is due, the drawing officer will be required to make good the excess

amount  so  drawn.  If  the  excess  amount  cannot  for  any  reason  be

recovered from the drawing officer, the Government servant, if  any, who

countersigned the bill will be liable to make good any loss arising from

culpable negligence on his part, and the Treasury officer who passed it
will  be  similarly  liable  to  make  good  any  loss  arising  from  culpable

negligence on his part.

61.          The Accountant General is responsible for the auditing of all expenditure

charged against the Government . If any item of expenditure is found to

be  irregular  or  in  excess  of  what  is  due,  he  proceeds  to  remove  the

irregularity  or  recover  the  excess  amount  paid  through  the  Treasury

Officer  and  he  usually  issues  a  warning  slip  to  the  drawing  officer

concerned at the same time. When an item of expenditure incurred is less

than what is actually due for payment and the amount involved is not

53

insignificant, the Accountant General informs the drawing officer of the

fact leaving him to prefer an additional claim or not as he thinks proper.

             While an officer is under suspension and is in receipt of subsistence grant,

the retrenchment order in respect of any overpayment made to him in the

post shall be issued by the Accountant General in consultation with authority

competent to place the officer under suspension. The aforesaid administrative

authority will exercise discretion whether recovery should be held wholly in

abeyance or it should be effected at full or reduced rates depending on the

circumstances of each such case.

*62.       Recoveries from a Government servant should not ordinarily be made at a

rate  exceeding  one-third  of  his  pay  unless  the  Government  servant

concerned has (a) in receiving or drawing the excess acted contrary to

orders or without due justification or (b) taken an advance for a specific

purpose,  not  utilised  it  for  the  purpose  for  which  the  advance  was

54

sanctioned  within  the  prescribed  period  and  failed  to  refund  the

outstanding amount within the stipulated date.

63. (a)      Every Government servant should give proper attention to all objections and

orders and other points requiring settlement received from the Accountant

General without any avoidable delay, even though the responsibility for the

removal  of  objections  and  the  settlement  of  other  points  raised  in Audit

devolves  primarily  upon  disbursing  officers,  heads  of  offices  and

controlling authorities. Objection slips/audit notes  received from Audit   Office

should be replied to within a fortnight from the date of receipt of the objections.

In case any objection is not replied to within one month from the date of the

issue, the Audit Officer will have authority to direct the Treasury to refuse

encashment  of  further  bills  of  the  same  class  presented  by  the  officer

concerned or of a different class if the bill in respect  of which the objection

has been issued is an occasional one. The names of the officers who keep

the  objections  for  which  they  are  responsible,  unremedied  for  more  than

three months will be reported to Government by the Audit Officer. In case of

repeated delays in the matter of clearing objections, Government will not
hesitate to order the stoppage of the pay of the officers concerned. If owing

to delay in dealing with the matter, any amounts become unadjustable they

items  of  objections  in  the  same  objection  slip  received  from  the

Accountant General separate serial numbers should be given for each

of them.

Inspection  Reports

     (c)        During the course of local inspection, the Audit staff will be issuing ‘memos’
calling for information on various points. The departmental officers should
ensure that the particulars given in reply to such memos are correct with
reference  to  the  records.  For  this  the  Head  of  the  Office  should  make
necessary arrangements to see that the replies to audit memos are furnished
only  after  approval  by  proper  authority.  Further,  before  finalising    the
inspection  report  the Audit  Officer  should  discuss  the  more  important
irregularities noticed during the course of Audit with the Head of the Office.
The Head of the Office should see that all relevant materials are made available
to Audit. He should initiate action to rectify irregularities, defects, omissions,
etc., which came to light during the course of audit without waiting for the
receipt of the inspection report.

               The first replies to inspection reports should be sent within four weeks from
the date of receipt of the inspection report. The first replies should not be
delayed on any account. In respect of those particular paras for which final
replies could not be furnished to the Accountant General within the time
limit, an interim reply should be given indicating the action taken to rectify
the defects pointed out. Here again the Head of the Office should ensure
that the replies are factually correct and that proper steps are taken to avoid
recurrence of such defects.

   *Note:– Audit observations and inspection reports or copies of extracts
thereof received from audit should not be   passed on to private parties.

   *(d)    In order to watch the receipt of Inspection Reports and also to ensure that
first replies are sent within the prescribed time limit and the final replies as
expeditiously as possible the following instructions should be adhered  to:–

(i)       A register in Kerala Financial Code Form 4-B, Kerala Financial Code,
Vol. II should be maintained in every office to note the details of the
pending Inspection Reports and paras.

(ii)    Details of all Inspection Reports and outstanding paras should be
entered  in  the  register  with  the  help  of  half  -yearly  statements
received from the Accountant General.

(iii)   This register should be inspected by the Head of Office or an Officer
authorised  in  this  behalf  atleast  once  in  a  month  and  instructions
issued  for  the  speedy  clearance  of  the  outstanding  paras  wherever
necessary.

57
64.           The Head of the Office should ensure that where a particular type of payment

has  been  objected  to  by Audit,  a  similar  payment  is  not  made  thereafter
before the audit objection is finally cleared.

CHAPTER  IV

ESTABLISHMENTS,  CLAIMS  OF  GOVERNMENT  SERVANTS
AND  RECOVERIES  FROM  THEM

(i)    INTRODUCTORY

    Scope of the Chapter

67.         The scales of pay for the various services and posts under the Government

are  generally  fixed  by  the  statutory  rules  governing  the  conditions  of

service relating to those services or posts respectively. The scale of pay for

a post which has not been included in any service is generally fixed by a

contract  made  with  the  person  appointed  to  the  post  or  by  an  executive

order  issued  by  the  competent  authority  which  creates  the  post.  The

salaries  of  certain  posts  are,  however,  specially  fixed  either  by  the

Constitution of India and the orders and directions issued under it or by an

Act of the Kerala Legislature. The Kerala Service Rules contain the general

rules  which  govern  the  pay,  increments,  additional  pay,  allowances

including travelling allowances and leave salary of Government servants,

subject to any special provisions contained in any order of appointment to

a post under a contract or in the respective Service Rules. The forms 

in

which bills for drawing the pay and other emoluments due to Government

servants  should  be  prepared,  the  persons  who  should  sign  and  present

them at the treasury and the duties of Treasury Officers in regard to such

bills are prescribed in the rules in Part V of the Kerala Treasury Code. This

chapter  contains  the  financial  rules  relating  to  the  creation  of  additional

posts or establishments, the claims of Government servants, the recoveries

59
to be made from pay and allowances and other cognate matters.

     Powers of Government to Create and Abolish Posts

68.           The Government have power to create or abolish any post in connection with

the  affairs  of  the  State  except  those  posts  coming  under  an  ‘All  India

Service’. Under Article 312 (I) of the Constitution of India read with Section

59

CHAPTER III ]

     [ ARTS.  65-66

3 of the all India Services Act, 1951 (No. LXI of 1951) the power to make rules

to  regulate  the  recruitment  and  the  conditions  of  service  of  persons

appointed to an ‘All India Service’ rests with the Central Government. The

number  and  character  of  posts  included  in  an  ‘All  India  Service’  are

determined by the Central Government in consultation with the States and

are filled by persons appointed by the Central Government. Any alteration in

the number or character of such posts can also be made only by the Central

Government.

(ii)  ESTABLISHMENT

60

            Powers of Subordinate Authority to Sanction Additional Establishments

69. (a) No authority subordinate to the Government may sanction the creation of

any additional establishment, permanent or temporary except to the extent

and subject to the conditions mentioned in the Book of Financial Powers.

The delegation specified there are subject to the General conditions-

(1)      that  either  a  sufficient  specific  appropriation  for  the  expenditure

involved  already  exists  or  provision  can  be  made  for  it  by
reappropriation  by  the  sanctioning  authority  under  its  own  powers

without reference to the Government, and

(2)     that the provisions of the Kerala Service Rules are observed in fixing

the pay of the persons appointed to hold the posts created under the

delegated powers.

       (b)      An order sanctioning a temporary establishment should invariably specify

the period for which it is sanctioned. It should also specify the date from

which the sanction for a temporary establishment will take effect. If no date
is specified, the sanction will take effect from the date of actual employment

of the staff or of the Head of the staff.

     (c)    When a person is appointed substantively to a post in a class or grade of

appointments in  an establishment over and above its sanctioned strength

60

  CHAPTER IV ]          ESTABLISHMENT,  CLAIMS,  RECOVERIES  [ ARTS.  67-68

without at the same time increasing the sanctioned  number of posts in the
class or grade, the officer so appointed is termed a ‘Supernumerary’ in that

class or grade. Such an appointment may be sanctioned by the Government,

when owing to reduction in an establishment or for any other reasons, they

consider it necessary to retain the services of an officer without adding to

the permanent strength of the establishment. When such an appointment is

sanctioned, it shall be the duty of the Head of the Department or office to

absorb in the first vacancy, permanent or acting, that occurs in the class or

grade  after  the  appointment  of  the  supernumerary  and  no  vacancy

occurring  in  that  class  or  grade  shall  be  filled  up  until  all  the  existing

supernumerary officers are absorbed. Supernumeraries should not be shown

as belonging to a separate class by themselves, but should be shown as a

belonging to the particular class or grade to which each of them belongs,

along with the other incumbents, constituting that class or grade.

   Note:– For the purpose of this rule, all the non-gazetted ministerial officers

of an office or establishment shall be treated as belonging to a single

class and similarly all the last grade Government servants.

            In making appointments of ‘supernumeraries’ the following principles

should be generally followed:-

        (i)          A supernumerary post is normally created to accommodate the lien of

an Officer, who in the opinion of the authority competent to create

such a post is entitled to hold a lien against a regular permanent post

but who, due to non-availability of a regular permanent post, cannot

have his lien against such a post.

61

        (ii)         It is normally a shadow post  i.e., no duties are attached to such a post.

The officer, whose lien is maintained against such a post, generally

performs duties in some other vacant temporary or permanent post.

61

                                      THE  KERALA  FINANCIAL CODE  VOL  I

CHAPTER IV ]

          [ ART.  69

        (iii)      It can be created only if another vacant permanent or temporary post is

available to provide work for the person whose lien is retained by the

creation of the supernumerary post. In other words, it should not be

created in circumstances which, at the time of the creation of the post

or thereafter, would lead to an excess of the working strength.

        (iv)    It is always a permanent post. Since, however, it is a post created for

accommodating  a  permanent  officer  till  he  is  absorbed  in  a  regular

permanent posts, it should not be created for an indefinite period as

other permanent posts are, but should normally  be created, for a    definite

62

and fixed period sufficient for the purpose in view.

        (v)       It is  personal to the officer for whom it is created and no other officer

can be appointed against such a post. It stands abolished as soon as

the officer for whom it was created vacates it on account of retirement

or  confirmation  in  another  regular  permanent  post  or  for  any  other

reason. In other words, no officiating arrangements can be made against

such  a  post.  Since  a  supernumerary  post  is  not  a  working  post,  the

number of working posts in a cadre will continue to be regulated in a

manner  that,  if  a  permanent  incumbent  of  one  of  the  regular  posts

returns to the cadre and all the posts are manned one of the officers of

the cadre will have to make room for him. He should not be shown

against a supernumerary post.

        (vi)       No extra financial commitment is involved in the creation of such posts

in  the  shape  of  increased  pay  and  allowances,  pensionary  benefits,

etc.

        (vii)     Heads of Departments should maintain a record of the supernumerary

posts, the particulars of the individuals who hold liens against them

and the progressive abolition of such posts as and when the holders of

the  posts  retire  or  are  absorbed  in  regular  permanent  posts  for  the

purpose of verification of service for pension.

         [ ARTS.  70-71

              Additions to Establishment or increase in the

Emoluments of Existing Posts

70.          The Head of the Department or other authority concerned should scrutinise

with the greatest care every proposal for an addition to an establishment,

whether permanent or temporary, or for an increase in the emoluments of an

existing post. He should examine, the financial implications thoroughly and

should not submit the proposal to the Government unless he is satisfied that

it is essential.

               In connection with every proposal for alteration in an establishment, it should

be considered whether a claim for pension will arise in consequence of the

proposed  alteration,  and  a  certificate  should  be  furnished  that  this  has  been

done.

              PRINCIPLES  TO  BE  OBSERVED  IN  PUTTING  UP  A  PROPOSAL

FOR   ADDITIONS  OR  ALTERATIONS  IN  THE

ESTABLISHMENT  OF  AN  OFFICE

         A.  Scales of pay for New Posts

71.         The scale of pay proposed for a new post, whether temporary or permanent,

should be the time-scale as that already in force for posts of the same class

or category except when a different time-scale has been fixed for temporary

posts  in  a  particular  department  or  when  temporary  posts  in  a  particular

department  are  generally  sanctioned  on  the  minima  of  the  scales  of  the

corresponding permanent posts. When the new post to be created will form

an  addition  to  a  cadre  which  is  divided  into  grades,  the  pay  of  the  post

63

should  ordinarily  be  that  of  the  lowest  grade  ;  if  a  higher  rate  of  pay  is

proposed,  the  special  reasons  for  proposing  the  higher  rate  should  in

variably  be  stated.  If  there  is  no  post  in  existence  similar  to  the  one

proposed, the following principles should be observed in proposing a rate

of pay for the new posts:—

63

                                      THE  KERALA  FINANCIAL CODE  VOL  I

CHAPTER IV ]

   [ ART.  71

          (i)       if the post is to be filled by a person not already in Government service,

the  pay  proposed  should  be  the  minimum  necessary  to  secure  the

service of a person capable of discharging efficiently the duties of the

post;

    (ii)      if the post is to be filled by a person, who is already a Government

servant, the pay proposed should be appropriate with reference to the

nature and responsibility of the work to be done and the existing pay of

Government  servants  whose  status  is  such  that  they  are  considered

likely to be suitable for selection for the post.

64

         B. Details to be furnished with Establishment Proposals

     (a)    Every proposal to add to or to make a change in an existing establishment

should be explained fully in the communication addressed to the authority

competent to sanction the proposal.

The following information should invariably be furnished therein:—

        (i)         the reasons for considering the addition or the change proposed to be

necessary;

      (ii)         the present cost either of the section or sections affected (See Article

74 below) or of the total establishment as the circumstances may require;

    (iii)         the corresponding cost after revision;

    (iv)         the extra cost involved ;

      (v)          the number and date of the latest order. Sanctioning and addition to or

a change in the existing establishment ;

     (vi)          the increase or decrease in cost against each post or class or category

of posts affected;

   (vii)     in the case of a temporary establishment the period for which it is

proposed that it should continue ;

64

CHAPTER IV ]

  ESTABLISHMENT,  CLAIMS,  RECOVERIES

   [ ARTS.  71-72

  (viii)         when the pay of any post, existing or proposed, rises from a minimum
to a maximum by periodical increments the average monthly cost based

on the formula laid down in the Kerala Service Rules; and

     (ix)      the details of the number and pay of the posts, if any, which it is

proposed to add to the establishment and of the number and pay of

the posts, if any, of which it is proposed to change the conditions.

       Note 1:– Government servants borne on a State cadre, e.g., Investigators

in the Department of Statistics and the Clerks and Sub Registrars of

the  Registration  Department,  constitute  separate  establishments  by

themselves,  and  whenever  any  increase  or  decrease  of  their

establishments  is  proposed  the  proposal  should  be  for  that  class  of

officers only and for the whole State without the specification of any

other  class  of  establishment  in  any  particular  district.  The  same

procedure should be followed in regard to Gazetted Officers.

       Note 2 :– In determining the extra cost, allowances whether fixed or variable

should  be  included.  The  estimated  extra  cost  due  to  variable

allowances cannot be exact but it should be as accurate as possible.

      (b)     When a scheme involves any alteration of the number of character of posts

relating  to  the All  India  Services  and  consequently  the  sanction  of  the

President is necessary for a part of the scheme, the proposal submitted to

the Central Government should contain full details of such items and of any

other part of the schemes so connected with them. Unless it is explained, it

will be difficult for the Central Government to decide whether to accord their

sanction or not. Details of the remaining parts of the scheme need not be

65

furnished.

        Variation in Sanctioned Pay of a Post

72.          The Head of a Department or Office is not at liberty to re-adjust the pay of a

Government servant by giving one person more and another less than the

65

                                      THE  KERALA  FINANCIAL CODE  VOL  I
CHAPTER IV ]

    [ ARTS. 72-73

sanctioned pay of his post. But in the case of departments or establishments

divided into classes or grades an excess appointment made in a lower class

or  grade  against  vacancy  left  unfilled  in    a  higher  class  or  grade  is
permissible, provided the duties of the appointment in respect of which such
arrangements are made are the same or similar. The liberty  must not be used
however for the purpose of increasing the numerical strength of an office,
and for each vacancy in a higher class or grade, only one extra  appointment
in a lower class or grade is admissible.

   Note:– This rule is applicable to ministerial establishment also.

66

           Special Rules Regarding Temporary Establishments

73.       The following additional rules should be observed as regards temporary

establishments:-

(i)         When pay in excess of the rate of the lowest appointment or grade in the
establishment to which the extra appointment is added, is          sanctioned,
the  special  rate  thus  sanctioned  shall  be  drawn  by  the  person  who
actually does the work for which the temporary addition is made to the
establishment and by no one else.

(ii)         If the officer holding a permanent appointment is deputed to hold such
a temporary post, his emoluments shall be regulated under the Service
Rules.

(iii)     The sanction to a temporary appointment or establishment  should
specify the period for which it is sanctioned. In cases where this is not
feasible, the sanction has to be renewed every six months. The term for
which an appointment or establishment is sanctioned should not be
spread over several broken periods.

(iv)      No temporary establishment should be continued in anticipation of
sanction. Should there be a need for renewal of sanction, application
should be submitted so as to reach Government sufficiently early to
enable them to pass orders before the sanctioned period expires. Officers
who did not dispense with the temporary establishments on the dates on

66

   [ ARTS.  73-74

which the sanction expires will render themselves personally liable for the
expenditure involved.

    Distribution  of  Non-Gazetted  Establishments  in to  Sections

74.

For  the  purposes  of  audit  and  the  preparation  of  pay  bills,  the Accountant
General  divides a non-gazetted establishment, when necessary, into sections in
consultation with the Head of the Department or of the office on the following
principles:-

     (a)      The  division  should  be  uniform  throughout  the  State  for  the  same

classes of  establishments.

      (b)       Ordinarily an office or establishment containing not more than 12 clerks
should form a single Section; larger offices will comprise two or more.

   (c)    The distribution in the latter case should follow the actual working
arrangements of the office, e.g., the Government Press establishment
is  divided  into    General,  Reading,  Machine,  Binding,  etc.
Sections.Sometimes, for the sake of  convenience, the Sections are
numbered in numerical order as Section No. 1, Section No. 2, Section
No. 3, etc.

      (d)     In large offices where members of the ministerial services are arranged by
classes  and  grades  such  as  Superintendent,  Upper  Division  Clerk  and
Lower Division Clerk, each class or grade may form a separate Section.

      (e)      Petty and numerous establishments are often best distributed according
to the taluks, e.g., the pay of all Village staff in one taluk may be drawn in
one bill.

    (f)   Clerks, Teachers, etc., should not except in small establishments be
combined with Last Grade Government Servants. The latter should,
when their number is not very small form a separate Section or  Sections.

67

       Note 1:– Parts of an establishment under the same Head of an Office
which are charged for under different Major Heads should be treated
as  separate establishments.

   Note 2:– The Accountant General  issues from time to time a list of the

purpose in the relevant departmental code or Manual or elsewhere in Form 7.
As a general rule, the reports of the transfer of charge should be signed both
by the relieved and relieving officers. District Officers and the Heads of the
Departments should also send copies of their reports to the Chief Secretary
to  Government  on  the  same  day. An  acknowledgement  of  the  permanent
advance in Form 8 should also be sent by the relieving officer on the same
day, to the Accountant General . A copy of the report of the transfer of charge
should be sent simultaneously to the Treasury Officers concerned and the
copies of the report sent to the Accountant General  and the Head of the
Department or other authority specified in the departmental Code or Manual
should contain an endorsement to this effect.

     Note 1:– If the charge reports are jointly signed by the relieved and relieving

officers countersignature by a superior authority is not necessary.

    Note 2:– In cases where the charge reports cannot be signed conjointly by

the relieved and the relieving officers due to administrative difficulties

the countersignature of the superior authority should be incorporated

in the charge reports before they are communicated to Audit. The Heads

separate  copy  of  Report  of  Transfer  of  charge  to  the Accountant

General (A&E) with the duly filled up covering letter on the  facing

page of the reports  of Transfer of  Charge.

become  entitled  to  draw  pay  and  allowances  simultaneously  for  the  same

appointment,  the  Superintending  Engineer  should      inform  the Accountant

General whether the time taken for the transfer of charge is reasonable, and
whether the relieving officer should be treated as having been on duty for
the full period. If the Superintending Engineer considers that the time taken
in making over and receiving charge in a     particular case was excessive, the
relieving officer should be treated as if he had been on joining time or on
leave as the case may be for so much of the time as is held to be in excess of
the time reasonably necessary.

     (c)      Every officer who is responsible for the adjustment of advances, and who is

outstanding against him should leave for the information and guidance of
his  successor  a  memorandum  clearly  explaining  the  state  of  accounts  of
each item of advance and noting the action to be taken for adjusting the
outstanding amounts within the time allowed by the sanctioning authority.
If he does not do so, his responsibility will not cease and his successor may
not be held responsible in respect of the items not brought to the latter’s
notice.

given by  the relieved to the relieving officer in the prescribed forms and a

should bring to notice anything irregular or objectionable in the conduct
of business that may have come officially to his notice. He should examine
the  accounts,  count  the  cash,  inspect  the    stores,  count,  weigh  and
measure certain selected articles in order to test accuracy of the returns. He
should also describe the state of the account records.

is not a Gazetted Officer, he must at once report the circumstances to his
nearest departmental superior and obtain orders as to the cash in hand, if
any.

ability, unless the gross amount of the claim is less than * ` 7,500 in
which case the authority accepting the indemnity bond  in Form No 9

Advances for Travelling Expenses for Tours

88.         When satisfied that it is really necessary, the competent authority as shown

in the list below may grant an advance towards travelling expenses to an

officer during a journey on tour, including any journey for which travelling

allowance is admissible as for a journey on tour (See also Article 100).

The amount advanced, should in no circumstances, exceed the amount of

travelling allowance which the sanctioning authority expects the Government

88

servant to become entitled for the journey and should also not exceed the

sum likely to be required to meet the Government servant’s personal travelling

expenses for a month or for the probable duration of the tour, whichever is

shorter. The  advance  should  be  charged  to  the  final  head  of  expenditure

concerned. Advances for meeting travelling expenses for tours may be drawn

as and when journeys have to be performed. But advances so drawn should

be adjusted in full in the final Travelling Allowance bill for the month  which

should be drawn before the close of the month following the month  in which

the  journey  was  performed  failing  which  further  advances  for  travelling

expenses will not be admissible.

        (iv) DEDUCTIONS  FROM  PAY  BILLS  OF  GOVERNMENT  SERVANTS

    1.  FUND  DEDUCTIONS

89.            Every Government servant who draws any pay bill should enter in it correctly

the deductions, if any, to be made on account of various Provident Funds.

He  should  carry  out  promptly  and  fully  any  order  received  from  the

Accountant General or any other Audit Officer of a fund to make a particular

deduction or series of deductions.

                  All Heads of Offices and Disbursing Officers should observe the following

procedure in regard to Provident Fund deductions:–

        (i)        As soon as a Government servant is admitted to the Provident Fund,
the Provident Fund account number allotted to him should be noted
on the right hand top of page 1 of his Service Book with rubber stamp
or in red ink.

        (ii)        When Government servants are transferred from one office to another
their Service Books should be made available to the new office as soon
as possible within one month of the transfer, in any case.

         (iii)      The Last Pay Certificate (completed in all respects) should be promptly

sent to the new office.

        (iv)     The head of the new office should verify the account number noted in
the Last Pay Certificate by reference to the Service Book and ensure
that the account number is correct.

89

        (v)     A complete list of subscribers to each fund should be maintained in

each disbursing office.

          (vi)      Each new subscriber should be brought on this list and any subsequent
changes resulting from his transfer or in the rate of subscription, etc.,
should be clearly indicated in the list.

            [ ART.  89

      (vii)   When a subscriber dies, quits service or is transferred to another

office, full particulars should be duly recorded in the list.

        (viii)     In the case of the transfer of a subscriber to another office, the necessary

note of transfer should be made in the lists of both the offices.

        (ix)       From this list, the monthly Provident Fund Schedule to be appended to

the pay bills should be prepared and tallied with the recoveries made,

before the submission of the bill to the treasury for payment.

  Note:–A  certificate  to  the  effect  that  all  persons  who  had  to  subscribe

90

compulsorily to the General Provident Fund under the rules had actually

joined    the  Fund  will  be  recorded  by  all    Drawing  Officers  in  the

Establishment Pay bills for the months of April and October every year.

     2.    DEDUCTION  ON  ACCOUNT  OF  INCOME- TAX

(a)     Every Disbursing Officer who disburses the salary of any Government
servant should  make the appropriate deduction of income tax from it at

the time of payment in accordance with the Income tax Act, 1961 (43 of

1961) as subsequently amended, and the rules and directions contained

in the Income-tax Manual and other orders of competent authorities.

(b)   Every Government servant who pays any amount to a Government

servant on account of a reward, examiner’s fees, or any  similar item not

strictly  included  under  the  head  of  ‘pay  and  allowances’  should

communicate  the  details  to  the  Income-tax  Officer  concerned  in  a

separate letter or memorandum when he makes the payment.

          3.  DEDUCTION OF AMOUNTS DUE TO CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES

                Where the Acts under which Co-operative Societies are registered impose a

statutory obligation on Government to make recoveries from the salary of

Government servants on account of dues to such Societies and also provide

for the execution of an agreement by the members in favour of the Societies

   CHAPTER IV ]

ESTABLISHMENT,  CLAIMS,  RECOVERIES

          [ ART.  89

requiring the employer to make such recoveries, it shall be obligatory on the
part of Drawing and Disbursing Officers /Treasury Officers to recover such

dues. The amount shown in the requisition in writing received from the Co-

operative  Societies  shall  be  recovered  in  accordance  with  the  following

procedure:–

            (a)     Where the whole or a part of the attachable portion of the salary of the

Government  employee  concerned  is  already  under  attachment,  the

recoveries  on  account  of  the  demands  from  Co-operative  Societies

shall be made from that portion of his salary as is not liable to attachment

under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.

        (b)        Where the Government servant draws his own bills, it shall be the duty

of the Head of the Office receiving the requisition from the co-operative

society  to  send  the  necessary  intimation  to  the  Treasury  Officer  or

other Disbursing Officer concerned. On receipt of such intimation the

Treasury Officer or other Disbursing Officer shall make recoveries from

the salary of the officer and the amounts thus recovered shall be paid

to  the  Co-operative  Society  without  undue  delay  after  deducting

remittance charges, if any.

    (c)      In the case of non-gazetted Government servants, on receipt of the

requisition in writing from the Society, it shall be the duty of the Drawing

and Disbursing Officer of the Government servant concerned to make

the  recoveries  in  satisfaction  of  the  requisition.  The  Drawing  and

Disbursing Officer shall draw the gross amount of pay and allowances

of the Government servant concerned, in the usual manner, but should

91

disburse  only  the  net  amount  after  making  recoveries.  The  amount

thus recovered should be paid to the Co-operative Society concerned

without undue delay after deducting the remittance charges, if any.

     (d)     In  cases  where  the  Government  servant  concerned  intentionally
allows his pay to remain undisbursed or undrawn with a view to

evading payment on account of dues to co-operative societies, the
administrative head of the Department concerned should draw the
pay of the debtor-employee under intimation to him, in satisfaction
of the requisition received from the co-operative society and remit
the amount to the society, without undue delay, after deducting the
remittance charges, if any.

      The amount recovered, in accordance with clauses (a), (b), (c) or (d)
above shall be treated   in the account in the same way as salary paid to
the Government servant concerned,  the particulars of the requisition
received from the co-operative society being cited in the pay bill or
acquittance rolls as an authority for the charge and the receipt of the
co-operative society for the amounts remitted to it shall be filed with
such  suitable  records  as  may  be  kept  by  the  Disbursing  Officer,
including a Treasury Officer.

92

                      A disbursing officer, even when not located within the territorial limits
to which the Act under which a co-operative society has been registered
applies, may effect recoveries on account of dues of such a co-operative
society from the salary payable to a Government servant:

                      Provided that such Government servant gives in writing an authorisation
to his disbursing officer to make the recoveries in respect of such dues and
the  disbursing  officer,  before  effecting  recoveries,  ensures  that  the
authorisation  given  to  him  by  such  Government  servant  is  clear,
unambiguous and has not been revoked.

              4.  DEDUCTION  ON  ACCOUNT  OF  ATTACHMENT  OF  PAY

AND  ALLOWANCES  BY CIVIL  COURTS

      (a) The extent to which the emoluments of a Government servant are exempt
from attachment for debt is specified in Section 60 (1) of the Code of Civil

Procedure, 1908 (Central Act V of 1908 ) as subsequently amended. The

or Sub Treasury Officer should recover any amount attached by the order
of a court from emoluments. The responsibility for recovering an amount
of this kind from the emoluments of any Government servant who does
not draw his pay on a separate bill, by making the necessary deductions
in the establishment bill, rests on the Head of the Office. If the Treasury
or Sub Treasury Officer or the Head of the Office, as the case may be,
receives a relevant attachment order from a court sufficiently early before
the  end  of  the  month  (See Article  76),  he  should  see  that  the  amount
attached is deducted from the bill concerned. Every Treasury Officer, Sub
Treasury  Officer  and  Head  of  Office  should  carefully  maintain  an

is taken on all attachment orders received from courts.

proposal for insurance, submit to the Life Insurance Corporation a Letter of
Authorisation, in duplicate, requesting the Drawing Officer to deduct the
Premium due to the Corporation from his salary every month. The Government
servant should himself, at the time of proposing for insurance, remit the first
two  instalments  of  the  premium  direct  to  the    Corporation.      Only    the
subsequent   instalments will be deducted  from his salary, Vide Appendix-II.

CHAPTER  V

CONTINGENT CHARGES

Definition

90.          The term “Contingent charges” or “Contingencies” is applied to the incidental

expenditure, which is necessarily incurred in running an office. The main items

are common to most offices, e.g., expenditure on furniture, books and periodicals,

service  postage  and  telegrams,  bicycles,  electric  current,  cleaning  charges,

customs  duty  on  imported  stores,  freight  and  tour  charges.  It  includes  also

incidental expenditure which is required for technical or other special reasons in

the working of particular offices and departments, e.g., expenditure on clothing

and  other  equipments,  in  such  departments  as  the  Excise,  Jail  and  Police

Departments,  rewards  paid  to  non-officials,  diet  and  road  money  paid  to

prosecutors  and  Witnesses,  jurors  and  assessors,  law  charges,  dietary  and

medical charges in jails and hospitals, purchase of plant and Machinery and
laboratory equipment in colleges and schools, raw materials for conversion in to

manufactured articles in the jail Department and Government owned factories,

workmen’s  wages,  purchase  of  live-stock  for  the  manufacture  of  sera  and

vaccines and similar items. Expenditure incurred on hot  weather establishment,

labourers  engaged  in  departments  other  than  the    Forest  and  Public Works

Departments on daily or monthly wages, sweepers (whether whole-time servants

or  not)  in  all  departments  and  such  other  classes  of  menials,  e.g.,  dhobies,

tailors, gardeners as the Government may from time to time declare to be ineligible

for pension will also be treated as contingent expenditure.

97
                  The contingencies of special officers in the Public Works Department include

also expenditure on the supply of and repairs to tools and plant.

Extent of Application of this Chapter

91.            The rules in this Chapter apply primarily to contingencies of the kinds mentioned

in the preceding article but expenditure on petty construction and repairs dealt

with in chapter VII and other miscellaneous expenditure dealt with in Chapter

92. (a)   Heads of offices have been empowered to incur  or sanction expenditure on

ordinary and recognised contingencies subject to the following conditions:—

(1)    The expenditure should be non-recurring, that is, it should not involve

any  commitment  beyond  a  single  payment  unless  the  authority

concerned has been duly empowered to incur or sanction such recurring

98

expenditure.

3

  Exception 1:— The sanction of the Government is not required for the payment
of Municipal or other local tax, whatever its amount, on Government
property, if the tax, has been assessed by the competent authority and
the certificate required in Rule 3 (a) of Article 117 is duly furnished.  If
the Government servant who receives the notice of demand considers
that the assessment is excessive, he should report the facts at once to
his immediate superior with full information as to the time allowed for
filing an appeal against the assessment and grounds on which an appeal
could be based.

  Exception 2:—Medical Officers on special duty on occasions of cholera or
other  emergency  are  permitted  to  engage  special  duty  servants  on
daily wages on condition that such servants are not domestic.

 Exception 3:—License fee payable under any State or Central Act or any
rules made thereunder can be paid by the Heads of the Office concerned
provided that he is satisfied with the genuineness and correctness of
the claim.

       (b)     The Head of an Office may delegate his power to incur or sanction expenditure
on contingencies to any Gazetted Government servant serving under him
subject  to  any  further  conditions  and  restrictions  which  he  may  consider
necessary in addition to those prescribed by the Government.

   CONTINGENT   CHARGES

  [ ARTS.  92-93

   Note:—  Special rules, restrictions, etc., prescribed by Government regarding
individual items of contingencies are laid down in Appendix 4 and in

the Book of Financial  Powers.

               When satisfied that it is unavoidably necessary, e.g., during his absence

from headquarters, the Head of the Office or other  gazetted Government

servant who is authorised to incur contingent expenditure may permit a

responsible  non-gazetted  subordinate  such  as  a  Head  Clerk  or  Office

Manager to incur urgent contingent expenditure of a specified kind or

kinds, up to the specified amount (which should be small) in anticipation

of his sanction.  Whenever he does so, he should arrange to scrutinize as

soon    as  possible  all  vouchers  for  contingent  expenditure  so  incurred

and pass them finally for payment.  If he disallows any item of charge or

part of an item he should recover the amount disallowed from  the payee

if he considers it desirable and finds it possible to do so, and otherwise

from the non-gazetted subordinate who incurred it in anticipation of his

sanction.

Government Officers are not entitled to send communications regarding

their leave, pay, transfer, leave allowance and other matters of a personal

nature at the expense of the State.

93.      (1)      No officer should incur any expenditure on contingencies which involves

a departure from the general and special rules prescribed in this Code or

any  expenditure  unusual  or  beyond  his  powers  of  sanction  unless  the

Government have specially sanctioned the expenditure.

99
             (2)       Special rules, restrictions etc., prescribed by Government regarding individual

items of contingencies as laid down in Appendix 4 and in the Book of Financial
Powers should be strictly observed.

          (3)     The total expenditure incurred by the Head of an Office in any financial year

should not exceed either the appropriation placed at his disposal or any limit

fixed  for  the  purpose  for  that  year.   The  existence  of  a  budget  allotment

CHAPTER V ]

 [ ARTS.  93-95

should  not,  however,  be    taken  to  justify  its  full  utilisation.    Heads  of

Departments and Offices should see that no expenditure is incurred out of the

budget grants unless really necessary in the interests of public service.

Permanent Advances

94.          As a general rule, a Government servant is only permitted  to draw money from

the Treasury on presenting a proper voucher prepared in accordance with the

rules so as to show the precise nature of the expenditure, and as a general rule no

money  may  be  drawn  from  the  Treasury  until  it  is  required  for  immediate

disbursement .  The permanent advance system is an exception to these general

100

rules.  Unforeseen expenditure often has to be incurred urgently, and it would

sometimes be very inconvenient to postpone such expenditure so as to fulfil the

formalities ordinarily  required for drawing money from the Treasury.  To enable

him to make disbursements of this kind before drawing the necessary bills, a

Government servant may be granted a permanent advance the amount of which

should be limited to what is absolutely essential to meet his ordinary requirements.

   Note:–*In cases of urgency, T.A. advance limited to the actual rail fares/bus

fares (both ways) may be paid out of the Permanent Advance to Non-

Gazetted Government Servants who are required to proceed on official

tours at short notice.

Rules regulating the Grant of Permanent Advance

95. (a)   The permanent advance of a Head of Department has to be fixed and sanctioned

by Government.

     (b)  Unless the Government directs otherwise, the Head of a Department may

sanction the grant to a Government servant serving under him of a permanent
advance not exceeding the amount which the Accountant-General considers

appropriate.

*Addition C.S.No.2/79 [G.O.(P) No. 476/79/Fin., Dated 17/05/1979]

100

CHAPTER V ]

CONTINGENT   CHARGES

 [ ARTS.  95-96

      (c)    Every order  sanctioning the grant  or a revision of  the amount of a permanent
advance should be communicated  both to the Government servant concerned

and to the Accountant-General.

       (d)     An application for the initial grant of a permanent advance or for the revision of

the  amount  of  an  existing  permanent  advance  should  be  submitted  to  the

authority competent to sanction it through the Accountant-General who will

state what amount, if any, he considers appropriate for the advance.  If any

difference of opinion arises between the Accountant-General and the Head of a

Department in this connection, the latter should submit the matter for the orders

of the Government.

       (e)   No permanent advance should be granted unnecessarily and no such advance

should  be  larger  than  necessary  in  view  of  the  obvious  subjections  to  the

retention of money outside the treasury.  A permanent advance sanctioned for

the use of the Head of an Office should be so fixed as to meet the needs of every

branch of his office; any amounts required by his subordinates should be allotted

from his advance and acknowledgments taken from them in a form similar to that

in which he furnishes acknowledgments himself to the Accountant-General.

96.         The holder of a permanent advance   is responsible for the safe custody of the

money placed in his hands and he must at all times be ready to produce the total

amount of the money in vouchers or in cash. On the 15th April of every year and

whenever  there  is  charge  of  the  incumbent  of  the  post  concerned  or  in  the

amount  of  the  advance  sanctioned,  every  Government  servant  who  holds  a

permanent  advance  should  forward  an  acknowledgment  to  the Accountant-

General for the amount of the permanent advance for which he has to render

101

account.  (The acknowledgment should be in Form No. 8 when there is a

change of incumbent and in Form No. 8A in other cases).  In the bill for their

pay and allowances for the month of April every year, all officers drawing

their own pay bills should give a certificate that the acknowledgment of

permanent advances as on 31st March of the preceding year has been sent

101

                                      THE  KERALA  FINANCIAL CODE  VOL  I
CHAPTER V ]

  [ ARTS.  96-97

to the Accountant-General.  In case no  permanent  advance is held by  an

Officer, a certificate to this effect should be attached.  In the case of officers

who  are  holding  sub  advances,  a  certificate  to  the  effect  that  the

acknowledgment  has  been  given  to  the  officer  who  is  holding  the  main

advance, should be given in the bill.

He should also record in the bill for his pay and allowances for the month of

April (to be cashed in May) every year a certificate that the acknowledgment

has been duly forwarded to the Accountant General.

   Note:– Retrenchments should not under any circumstances, be made good

102

from the permanent advance pending appeal or further reference as to

their validity.

Recoupment of Permanent Advance

97.            At the end of each calendar month and also when in the course of a calendar

month,  a  transfer  of  charge  takes  place  or  it  is  found  necessary  to  draw

money  for  contingent  expenses  e.g.,  when  the  balance  of  the  permanent

advance in hand has become inconveniently small, the cashier should rule a
red ink line across the page of the contingent register or registers maintained

in the office, add up the several columns and post the several totals for the

different classes of contingent charges in the bill or bills.  The form of the bill

for  countersigned  and  non-countersigned  contingencies  respectively  and

the instructions to be observed in preparing the bills are laid down in the

Kerala Treasury Code (see Rules 187 and 188 of Part V of the Kerala Treasury

Code).  The cashier should then lay the bill with the sub-vouchers and registers

before the Head of the Office or the gazetted Government servant whom the

Head  of  the  Office  has  authorised  to  incur  contingent  expenditure  under
Article 92 (b) and to sign contingent bills for him.  The Head of the Office or

the gazetted Government servant acting for him should carefully scrutinise

the entries, initial each entry in the Contingent Register, if this has not already

been done and sign the bill if it is in order and also the separate certificates,

102

CHAPTER V ]

CONTINGENT   CHARGES

 [ ARTS.  97-99

if any.  He should also invariably make suitable entries on the original sub-
vouchers to show that they have been paid, so that it will be impossible to

use  them  in  support  of  a  second  claim  and  he  will  be  held  personally

responsible if a second payment is made in respect of any item on account of

his not carrying out this instruction properly.  The cashier will then date and

number the bill and present it at the Treasury for payment.

   Note:– In all cases in which sub-vouchers are not required to be submitted

to the Accountant-General or other Controlling Officer, the Drawing

Officer  should  certify  in  the  bill  that  sub  voucher  other  than  those

attached to the bill have been so cancelled that they cannot be used

again.

98. (a)     When the permanent advance is running short and a payment which exceeds

the balance of the advance is due to be made the amount of that payment

may be entered in the Contingent  Register with the  number that the sub-

voucher will bear when the payment has been made, and included in the bill.

The payment should be made immediately after the bill is cashed.

       (b)    In an office in which the charges under several Major heads have to be met

from  a  single  permanent  advance,  it  is  not  necessary  to  prepare  bills  in

respect  of  those  heads  under  which  there  has  been  little  expenditure  on

every occasion when the permanent advance runs short.  The expenditure

under such heads should be totalled and the bills prepared only at the end of

the month in order to begin the following month with the full amount of the

permanent advance, or when there is a transfer of charge so that the relieving

Government  servant  may  send  to  the  Accountant-General  his

103

acknowledgment of having received the whole of the permanent advance in

cash.

               Temporary Advances for Specified purposes

99.           When a temporary advance is considered necessary for the purpose of meeting
contingent expenditure of a specified kind or on a specific occasion and it is not

103

CHAPTER V ]

 [ ARTS.  99-100

covered  by  standing  sanction  given  by  the  Government,  an  application  for

sanction should be submitted to the Government.  Occasionally, the Government

accord  a  standing  sanction  for  the  grant  of  such  temporary  advances  on  all

occasions of a particular kind.  For example, advances for the transport of opium

and  gunja,  advances  to  the  Inspector-General  of    Police  for  the  charges  in

connection with Railway Warrants, and advances to the Land Acquisition Officer

for the payment of compensation for land acquired under the Land Acquisition

Act.  ! The advance should be adjusted by detailed bills and vouchers subject to

the following conditions.

104

     (1)       A time limit of 3 months is fixed for the presentation of final bill.

      (2)        In cases where temporary advance is not utilised fully but the adjustment

bill is submitted in time, interest @18% per annum will be charged on the

utilised portion of the advance from the date of drawal to the date of refund

of advance.

      (3)        In cases where adjustment bill is not submitted within the prescribed time,

the entire amount of advance may be recoverd in one lump immediately on

the expiry of such time limit. Interest @18% will be charged on the entire

amount of advance from the date of drawal to the date of recovery of the

amount.

                 These amendments shall be deemed to have come in to force on the day of

October,2011.

                  Advances for Contingent charges to be incurred on Tour

*100.       When satisfied that it is really necessary, the Head of an office may sanction an

advance to himself or his assistant or deputy to cover contingent charges during
a journey or tour.  The amount advanced should not exceed the sum likely to be

required to meet contingent charges such  as those for the hire of conveyances

or animals for the transport of records, tents or other Government property
for a month or for the probable duration of the tour, whichever is shorter.  For

long tours in departmental vehicles, when  it may not be possible to get fuel

on credit officers may be provided with advance to meet the cost of fuel to

be purchased by  them.  Except in the Forest Department no part of any such

advance may be applied to any expenditure of a gazetted Government servant

for which his Travelling Allowance is intended to provide (see also Article

88).The  advance  should  be  charged  to  the  final  head  of  expenditure

concerned and should be adjusted by detailed bills and vouchers as soon as

possible.

   Advances for Law Charges

101.        A Government servant who has been duly authorised to incur any expenditure

on law charges in connection with law suits to which the Government are a

party may draw an advance for the purpose of meeting the expenditure.  The

advance should be drawn and accounted for as a contingent charge under

the final head of expenditure concerned.  For special rules and restrictions in

regard to law charges, [see Book of Financial Powers].

Cash Book

102.       Rule 92 (a) of the Kerala Treasury Code, Volume 1 lays down the procedure

for the maintenance of cash book and the duties of  the Head of Office in that

regard.  The note there under lays down that the functions assigned to the

Head of Office may be performed by any other Gazetted subordinate officer

specifically authorised by Government in this behalf.

105

When the Head of Office is absent on tour or otherwise the officer (gazetted

or  non-gazetted)  next  below  in  rank  and  present  shall  discharge    all  the
duties of the Head of  Office with regard to the maintenance of cash book

and verification of cash balance in accordance with the rules.  The Head of

Office, on his return, shall verify the correctness of the entries in the cash

book and other connected records, attest them and verify the cash balance

and shall record a certificate to this effect in the cash book [see also rule 131

(c) of the Kerala Treasury Code, Volume I ].

Classification of Contingent Charges

103.         For purpose of control and audit contingent charges are grouped as follows:-

1.  Countersigned contingencies; and

2.  Non-Countersigned contingencies.

106

                  Expenditure incurred by a Government servant on countersigned contingencies

is under the direct supervision of a higher authority, known as the Controlling

Officer or authority who signs the detailed bills relating to them.  Countersigned

contingencies are sub-divided into contingencies which require countersignature

before payment and contingencies which require countersignature after payment.

The detailed  bills for the former are submitted to the Controlling Authority for
scrutiny  and  countersignature  and  then  presented  at  the  Treasury,  duly

countersigned, for payment.  The monthly detailed contingent bills in respect of

countersigned contingencies that require countersignature only after payment

are submitted to the Controlling Authority for close scrutiny and countersignature

and the full details of the charges are not therefore entered in the abstract bills

presented for payment at the Treasury.  Special contingencies, i.e., contingent

charges which are of a special character ( whether recurring or non-recurring )

cannot be incurred without the special sanction in each case of a superior

authority.  These include supplies and services and periodical charges (such

as rents, etc.).

                   Appendix  5  contains  a  list  of  the  contingent  charges  that  require  the

countersignature of the Controlling Authority after payment.

            No detailed bills are sent to the Controlling Authority for non-countersigned

contingencies;  each  contingent  bill  for  non-countersigned    contingencies

presented for payment at the treasury should therefore contain full details of the

106

CHAPTER V ]

CONTINGENT   CHARGES

            [ ART.  103

expenditure and the sub-voucher for any individual payment exceeding * `1000
included in the bill, should be attached to it.  Such bills are sent straight to

the Accountant-General  for  audit  without  any  scrutiny  by  a  Controlling

Authority and the contingencies in this category are also therefore called

audited contingencies.  Sub-vouchers for expenditure on account of ‘Secret

Service Expenses’ will not be attached to the bills and the accounts  Secret

Service Expenditure are not subject to scrutiny by the Accountant-General.

The rules regulating the administration, supervision  and control of Secret

Service Expenses are contained in Appendix 6.

             ! All Sub-vouchers should be cancelled by the Drawing Officers irrespective
of the fact whether they are retained in their offices or sent to audit office.

              Contingent charges should be recorded and treated in the accounts as

charges  of  the  month  in  which  they  are  actually  disbursed  from  the

Treasury.

   Note 1:– Fixed contingent allowances which are payable regularly irrespective

of the actual expenditure incurred in any month, should be drawn in

the establishment pay bills.  In respect of officers where there are no

part-time  posts  of  contingent  employees  a  certificate  should  be

recorded by the Drawing Officer in each month’s bill  to the effect that

the amount drawn in the previous month’s bill was expended for the

purpose for which it was drawn.  Washing allowance paid to Class IV

Government servants shall be classified under salaries.

   Note 2:–When expenditure for which a lump sum is granted under a single

special sanction is continued for more than one month, the second and

107

subsequent month’s bills should bear a note of how much has been
spent up-to-date under the sanction.

  [ ARTS.  103-104

    Note 3:–  In the case of charges which require, by rule or practice, special
sanction of Government and for which provision has been included in

the budget, the Accountant-General will enforce such sanction being

obtained before the charges are actually incurred and paid.

            Note 4:— In drawing money from the Treasury on contingent bills it should

be noted that an amount sanctioned  for expenditure may not be drawn

in  a  lump  sum  simply  as  such.   A  sanction  is  an  authority  to  incur

certain expenditure within  certain authorised limits and not an order

upon which money may be drawn from the Treasury; the money must

108

be drawn on bills giving the necessary particulars, etc., and under the

usual rules, as required from time to time to meet actual expenditure.

Officers should save as much as possible in spending money against a

sanction, but the amount saved should remain  undrawn and should

not be considered as at the disposal of the disbursing officer for other

unsanctioned  purposes.

         Note 5:– If an officer, after drawing money on a contingent bill for certain

expenditure, finds that it is unnecessary to expend the whole or any

portion, of it, he should return the unexpended amount either by short-

drawing from the next contingent bill, in which a note should be given

specifying the date of the contingent bill, on which the expenditure

was drawn and the items in which the amount refunded was included or

by  refund  in  cash,  in  which  case  the  date  of  the  bill  on  which  the

amount was drawn must be quoted and particulars of  the item refunded

given.

Contingent Register

104.         Every item of contingent expenditure, whether the charge is to be countersigned
or not, should be recorded in a Register to be maintained in each office.
Separate registers may be opened, if convenient, for the countersigned and
non-countersigned contingencies respectively.  The unit for these registers

108

CHAPTER V ]

CONTINGENT   CHARGES

   [ ARTS.  104-105

should be the Major head of account and the general arrangement should be
as in Form 10.  The number of columns to be opened in the Register, the sub-
heads of appropriation and detailed account heads to be included and the
further  detailed classification, if any, required for purposes of control and
audit, cannot be the same for all departments and offices.  The Controlling
Authority  should  pass  orders,  on  these  points  in  consultation  with  the
Accountant-General,  in  the  manner  best  suited  to  the  conditions  of  each
department or office.  The accounts  maintained at the Treasury and by the
Accountant-General  contain  no  further  details  beyond  the  figures  under
Detailed  account  heads,  but  the  Contingent  Register  should  show  the
expenditure classified in detail under the several items falling under a detailed
account head for departmental purposes, e.g., the preparation and check of
contingent bills, the preparation of estimates, and financial control both by
the Head of the Office and by the superior authorities (See Article 115). The
expenditure on the less important and trivial items may be shown as a whole
in one column and the charges under each of these items need not then be
accounted  for  or  watched  separately.   Any  charge  for  which  a  special
explanation  is  required  should  be  described  in  the  column  headed
“Description”  though  the  amount  need  be  entered  only  in  the  relevant
separate column. The column headed “Description” should be used also for
noting the month or period to which any recurring charge (e.g., rent or pay of
menials) entered in one of the other columns relates. [*A separate register
should be maintained in Form No.10 A for showing such recurring charges.]

105. (a) Whenever the cashier makes a payment under the head of contingencies, he

should enter in the proper columns of the Contingent Register the date, the

name of the payee, the amount and the number of sub-vouchers.  If any

109

charge requires explanation, he should make the necessary entry in the column

headed “Description” and obtain the initials of the government servant who

incurred the charge against the entry.

      (b)  The Head of the Office or the Gazetted Government servant whom he has

authorised to incur contingent expenditure should initial against the date of

payment in respect of each item. If, owing to his absence, the entries in the

Register  have  been  initialled  by  a  non-gazetted  Government  servant,  the

Register should be reviewed and the entries reinitialled by the Head of the

Office or the Gazetted Government servant concerned as soon as he returns

to headquarters. The date of payment and the amount paid must be recorded

on each sub-voucher at the time of payment .

106.(a)   Advances made from the permanent advance, such as advances to last grade

110

Government  servants  for  Railway  and  bus  fares  for  journeys  on  duty,

advances for office expenses in camp, etc., should be entered at once in the

proper column of the Contingent Register i.e., the column headed “Advances”.

When each advance is subsequently adjusted, the fact should be noted in

the remarks column.

          (b)   The amount of bills paid by book transfer should be entered in the Contingent

Register in red ink, and the balance available should be reduced accordingly.

       (c)    A progressive total for each column should be struck monthly, immediately

after the monthly total.  It should include all payments and bills paid by book

transfer under each head from the beginning of the year upto the end of the

last completed month.  Care should be taken to arrange the heading of the

columns  of  the  Contingent  Register  according  to  those  printed  in  the

contingent bills.

        (d)   The allotments sanctioned for each head of expenditure should be entered in

the Register at the commencement of the year as also the additional allotments

and transfers that may be subsequently sanctioned.The expenditure should
be  worked  out  progressively  as  stated  supra,  and  regulated  carefully  in

accordance with the altered grants.

     Detailed monthly bills for Countersigned Contingencies

107.*(a) For contingencies that require countersignature by the Controlling Authority

after payment and in regard to which the permanent advance is recouped by

presenting abstract bills at the Treasury, the Head of the Office submits a

monthly detailed bill in Form 11 signed by himself to the Controlling Authority

for  countersignature  and  transmission  to  the Accountant-General.    The

detailed bill should reach the Controlling Authority not later than the 10th of

the month succeeding that to which it relates, supported by all sub-vouchers
for individual payments above. # ` 1000 and with a certificate regarding the
check and defacement of all sub-vouchers for amounts of    # ` 1000 or less.
It should be headed “Not payable at the Treasury” and printed on coloured

paper.   The  total  expenditure  under  each  of  the  detailed  items  by  which

accounts are kept in the Contingent Register should be entered in the detailed

bill, and at the foot of the bill a memorandum should be added showing the

number and date of every abstract contingent bill cashed at the Treasury

during the month to which the detailed bill relates and the sub-vouchers

included in each.  The total amount of the detailed bill should agree with the
amount actually drawn from the Treasury within the month.  Any difference

between the total amount of the detailed bill and the total charges shown in

the Contingent Register for the months should be fully explained.  If any
amount drawn on any abstract contingent bill cashed during the month has
been refunded into the Treasury, the date of refund should be stated.

       *(b) All Sub-vouchers should be cancelled by the drawing Officers irrespective
of the fact whether they are retained in their Offices or sent to audit office.

a full description of any item that required explanation.  The Countersigning
Authority should review the bill with the sub-vouchers.  If he disallows any
item, the fact should be noted in the bill and in the “Remarks” column of the
Register together with the number of the sub-voucher concerned and the
reasons  for  disallowance,  and  the  amounts  shown  in  the  Register  in  the
columns  affected  should  be  corrected  in  red  ink.    The  Countersigning
Authority should then enter the date of admission in the Register under his
initials, sign the bill and despatch it to the Accountant-General not later than
the 20th of the month*.  His signature to certificate that he is required to
furnish on the bill takes the place of the sub-vouchers for amounts above

                   A Countersigning Authority may authorise a responsible Gazetted Government
servant serving under him to examine and countersign the detailed monthly
contingent bills on his behalf when he is absent from headquarters.

                     A countersigned detailed contingent bill forwarded to the Accountant-General
should invariably be sent in a sealed cover.  The despatching clerk should
personally put each bill into the cover and seal it.

In the Countersigning Authority’s Contingent Register, the date of receipt

of a detailed bill should be entered in the column headed “Date of detailed

bill”,  and  the  date  of  its  despatch  to  the Accountant-General  should  be

entered  in  the  column  headed  “Date  of  admission  with  initials”.  In  the

Disburser’s Register, the date of recovery of any amount disallowed should

be entered in the column headed “date of admission with initials” and also

the date of any letter from the Countersigning Authority finally passing an

item disallowed  but not yet actually recovered. The particulars of any amount

disallowed should be recorded in the “Remarks” column of both registers on

the same line with the figures affected.

Amounts disallowed by the Countersigning Authority

110.         As  soon  as  the  bill  has  been  despatched  to  the Accountant-General,  the

Countersigning Authority should communicate to the Disburser the items, if

any,  disallowed.   The  Disburser  should,  without  fail,  refund  the  amount

disallowed by deducting it from the total of the next contingent bill which he

cashes on behalf of the same department.  The gross amount of each sub-

voucher should be entered in that bill, but below the total an entry in the

form“Deduct 

amount 

disallowed 

from  Contingent  Bill

No...........dated...........Rupees............” should be made.  The receipt given

should be only for the net amount drawn.  If the Countersigning Authority

finally withdraws the objection to any item, the amount should be re-drawn;

after the total of the sub-vouchers included  in the next contingent bill that

the Disburser cashed on behalf of the same department, an entry in the form

“Add amount disallowed from contingent Bill No...............dated .....................

refunded by deduction from contingent Bill No..........dated...........and re-

allowedin letter.....................dated.....................of..................” should be made.

The receipt given should be for the gross amount, and the item should be
included again in the next monthly detailed contingent bill submitted to the

Countersigning Authority.

               The totals in the Disburser’s Register are the totals of the amounts charged,

not of the amounts admitted by the Countersigning Authority, but when an

amount that has been disallowed is adjusted by deduction from the total of

a subsequent bill, the actual charge for each head may be worked out by

entering the amount retrenched in black ink with a minus sign in the column

113

for the retrenched head on the line of totals for the bill in which the adjustment

is made; the totals carried forward will then be correct.

List of  Abstract Contingent Bills

111.        The Accountant-General will send to each Controlling Authority every month

complete list of abstract contingent bills cashed by Government servants

been received.  The Controlling Authority should immediately call for the detailed

bills and the reasons for the delay in submitting them and return the list to the

Accountant-General as soon as possible with a note as to the action taken.

         Endorsement of Contingent Bills in favour of Private Parties

112.(a) *When a contingent charge exceeding  ` 1,000 is payable to a firm of suppliers, a
single party etc., separate contingent bill shall ordinarily be prepared for the

amount and endorsed for payment by Reserve Bank remittances drafts in cases

in which the drawing officers concerned is attached  to a banking treasury or a

114

treasury having currency chest  facility.  Where the drawing officer is attached to

a non-banking treasury without currency chest, the bill for the contingent charges
above  ` 1,000 shall be drawn in cash from the non-banking treasury and disbursed
to the payee in cash or by money order or by Bank Draft at the expense of the

payee.  Where payment is made by draft, the draft as and when obtained shall be

forwarded to the payee. This procedure is not applicable when funds required

for contingent expenditure are obtained by drawing cheques on the Treasury, or

when a payment has to be made outside the State. In cases where the payment

has to be made at a place outside the jurisdiction of the Drawing Officer, payment

should be arranged by means of Bank Drafts. When a Drawing Officer is satisfied

that there are special and exceptional reasons which make it desirable to endorse
a contingent bill for an amount below  ` 50 in favour of a Private Party, he may
record the reasons and act accordingly.

   Exception:– Electricity charges due to the Kerala State Electricity Board may be

paid in cash irrespective of  the amount involved.

        (b)    A contingent bill should not ordinarily be endorsed for payment to a private

party in March after the 15th.

     (c)   No endorsement on a contingent bill remains valid for longer than three
months  counting  from  the  date  of  issue.    Whenever  any  contingent  bill

issued in the last quarter of the year is endorsed for payment to a private

party, it should be stated in the endorsement that the payment order will

remain valid only upto the end of March.

      (d)   Whenever a contingent bill is endorsed for payment to a private party, the

Drawing Officer should immediately send an advice to the Treasury at which

it is to be paid, giving all the particulars of the bill.  He should see that the

item is entered at once in the Contingent Register in red ink with a note to the

effect that the amount has been drawn and attest the entries by his initials.

He should also see that an intimation is duly received from the Treasury as

to the payment of the bill and the date on which it is paid (See Rule 210 of

Part V of the Kerala Treasury Code).

       (e)    A  Drawing Officer may endorse a contingent bill in favour of a Government

servant subordinate to him.   A  private  party  in whose favour a contingent

bill has been  endorsed may re-endorse it in favour of a bank or a messenger
for collection; and a bank in whose favour such a bill has been re-endorsed
may re-endorse it in favour of a messenger for collection.

     (f)   When a bill for supplies made to the Government has been endorsed for
payment to a contractor and is re-endorsed by him in favour of a bank, he
should  sign  the  receipt  on  the  bill  as  well  as  a  separate  endorsement  in
favour of the Bank [See Rule 214 (c) of Part V of the Kerala Treasury Code].

      (g)   A contingent bill should not be used as a negotiable instrument except to the

Inter-Departmental Transfers

113.      * The conditions under which a department of Government may make charges
for  services  rendered  or  articles  supplied  by  it  and  the  procedure  to  be
observed in recording such charges in the accounts are given in Chapter IV
of Kerala Account Code, Vol. I.

116

                 The procedure laid down below should be followed for making payments in

the case of inter-departmental adjustments.

  Note 1:– Officers ordering, supplies etc., from a Government Department
have the same responsibilities that a cash purchase involves and are

responsible for authority, budget provision etc.  When a claim is to be

settled by presenting a Bill in the Treasury for adjustment, the officer

making the supplies or rendering services should indicate in the invoices

the head of account to which amount is to be credited.

  Note 2:– Where a Service Department levies some fees under an enactment

the payment should be made by other service departments either in

cash or through Bank drafts.

  Note 3:– (i) In the case of Service Departments making supplies or rendering

services to other Service Departments (except Public Works, Forest

and  other  Departments  which  are  vested  with  the  cheque  drawing
powers) involving manufacturing, production or supply of articles or

will on receipt of the invoice from the supplying officer, present a bill at
the Treasury for the cost of supplies/services along with the accepted

invoice and chalan ( in quadruplicate) indicating the designation of

the supplying officer, invoice No. and the head of account to which

the amount claimed is to be  credited.  The Treasury Officer will check

the head of classification noted in the chalan with that noted by the

supplying officer in the invoice and pass the bill for payment by transfer

credit  of  that  head  of  account  debiting  the  amount  to  the  head  of

account indicated in the bill by the supplied officer.  After adjustment

the Treasury Officer will retain the original copy of the chalan and

send the duplicate and triplicate to the supplied officer who will keep

one for   his office record and send the other to the supplying officer.

The fourth copy will be sent by the Treasury to the Accountant-General

along with the bill.

    (ii)    But in the case of issues of stores from stock or materials account of a

work within  a P. W. Division or between two such Divisions or between

one P. W. Division and another service department (Eg.  P. H. E. D.,
Forest  Department, Police Department, etc.,) and in the case of supplies

and services arranged by the Jail Manufacturies, adjustments will be

necessary irrespective of the amount involved.

     (iii)   Amounts due to the Public Works, Forest and other Service Departments

which are vested with the  cheque drawing powers should be settled by

adjustment of the bill presented by the supplied officer at the Treasury by

Transfer credit to “Public Works remittances/ Forest remittances”. “Items

      Note 5:– The commercial Departments or undertakings which are authorised

to draw cheques should settle the bills in respect of services rendered

or supplies made to them through cheques.  The amounts due to such

commercial Departments or undertakings from other Departments which
do  not have cheque drawing powers will be paid through bank drafts.
A  commercial  Department  or  undertaking  which  is  not  vested  with

      Note 6:–Departments which are engaged in rendering service or supplying

monthly a statement in Form. 12.

           Contingent Charges incurred on behalf of other Government Servants

114.        It is often expedient for a Government servant to make official purchases or

incur expenditure on behalf of the Government in another district, making his
arrangements  through  a  Government  servant  in  the  latter  district.    If  the

amount to be paid on account of contingent expenditure incurred in this way
is  not  less  than `  50  payment  should  be  made  by  Reserve  Bank  of  India
Drafts;  but  otherwise  every  Government  servant  who  actually  incurs

expenditure in this way should treat it as expenditure of his own office and

not demand payment from the Government servant at whose request he, as

an  agent,  has  incurred  the  expenditure.   The  charge  should,  however,  be

recorded  in  the  amounts  as  expenditure  of  the  department  in  which  the

Government servant who asks for the expenditure is serving.  A Government

servant should therefore address his application for any service of this kind

to the principal Government servant of his department in the district indented

on e.g., a Police Officer should ask the Superintendent of Police and not the

District Magistrate  to purchase blankets for him.  If the District Magistrate

receives any such indent from a Police Officer he should pass it on to the

Superintendent of Police who should deal with the charge  ( if it is less than

118

CHAPTER V ]

CONTINGENT   CHARGES

    [ ART.  114-115

` 50) as a final charge of his own office and apply to the proper authority  for
an extra appropriation, if his own appropriation will not be sufficient for the

financial year.  The Government servant who asks for the expenditure to be

incurred  is  always  responsible  for  obtaining  proper  sanction  for  the

expenditure.

  Note:– This rule does not apply to expenditure chargeable to Local Fund

which should always be recovered.

      Control of Contingent Expenditure against Appropriation

115.         Every  Government servant who incurs contingent expenditure should take

special care to see that he gets the best possible value for the money spent,

that  no  unnecessary  expenditure  is  incurred  and  that  he  does  not  spend

more than the amount placed at his disposal for the financial year.  Chapter

VI of the Budget Manual contains instructions as to the general procedure

for  the  control  of  expenditure  against  appropriation.    Further,  special

instructions are  necessary in regard to contingent expenditure since it is

incurred  without  the  sanction  of  any  higher  authority  except  in  certain

specified cases and the Government servant concerned has, to a considerable

extent, a free hand in incurring expenditure upto the limit of the appropriation.

Moreover, an appropriation for contingent charges under a particular detailed

account  head  often  covers  expenditure  on  a  number  of  distinct  and

individually important objects or classes of expenditure, e. g.,  the detailed

head “Contingencies — Miscellaneous”  may include charges on account

of  “Purchase  and  Repairs  of  bicycles”,  “Stationary  —  Local  Purchase”,

“Gardening”,  “Hot and cold weather  charges”  and  “Office Expenses”.  The

119

special instructions for the control of contingent expenditure are as follows:–

          (i)        The  appropriation  under  each  detailed  account  head  should  be

distributed among the important, items comprised in it.  If some of

the items are not important, those items taken as a whole may be
treated as a single important item for this purpose.  The expenditure

CHAPTER V ]

      [ ART.  115-117

on each important item under a detailed head of account should be
watched and controlled separately against the allotment for it, especially
when the charges are of a fluctuating nature.  The Contingent Register
prescribed  in  Article  104  is  designed  so  that  this  can  be  done
conveniently.

         (ii)      For countersigned contingencies, the monthly detailed bills provide all
the information required by the Controlling Authority for checking the
expenditure against the appropriation.If, for any month, the expenditure
exceeds the monthly proportion of the appropriation for the year, the
Disbursing Officer should send a report to the Controlling authority
along with the detailed bill furnishing the special reasons for incurring
the excess expenditure.  The Controlling Authority should scrutinise
the charges shown in  each detailed bill carefully and see that no charge
is unnecessary or excessive, that the sanction of competent authority
for any item requiring the sanction of a higher authority is attached,
that  the  sub-vouchers  required  have  been  received  and  are  in  order
and that the calculations are correct.

120

       (iii)       For non-countersigned contingencies, the controlling Authority should
get periodical statements from each Disbursing Officer ( monthly or at least
quarterly) of the progressive expenditure compared with the allotment
under each item for which there is a specific appropriation or allotment.  If
the expenditure is progressing too rapidly, he should instruct the Disbursing
Officer to curtail it to the necessary extent.  He should also during his local
inspections scrutinise the Contingent Registers of the officers under his
control and satisfy himself generally that the charges are necessary and
not excessive, the rates correct, the sanction obtained  adequate, etc.

    Service Postage Stamps

116.        Service  postage  Stamps  should  be  used  only  for  prepaying  postage  on

communications which are bona fide on the service of the Government and

for meeting other charges payable to the post office for which service postage

stamps are accepted.  They may also be used by a body or bodies included

120

CHAPTER V ]

CONTINGENT   CHARGES

  [ ARTS.  116-117

in the list in Rule 354 of the Indian Post and Telegraph Guide.  A Government
servant  who  is  associated  with  any  public  body  not  included  in  that  list

should, as required by Rule 355 of the same Guide, take care that service

postage  stamps  are  not  used  on  any  communications  issued  by  him  on

behalf of that body [See also instructions under Rules 192(a) and 221(c) of

Part V of the Kerala Treasury Code and item 46, Appendix 4 to this Code].

Rates and Taxes

117.       The following rules govern the payment of Municipal and other local taxes on

buildings, etc., occupied by departments of the Government or Government

servants under their administrative control:—

      (1)   Taxes on buildings not occupied as residences.— (a)  If the building is

occupied by a single department, that department should pay the taxes.

       (b)   If the building is occupied by more than one department or if the taxes

are payable in a lump sum for a number of buildings in a Municipal or

other  local area, the taxes should be paid by the Revenue Department

if  it  is  one  of  the  occupants  and  otherwise  by  the  Government
department  which  occupies  the  major  portion  of  the  building  in

consultation with the Executive Engineer concerned.

No part of the taxes so paid should be passed on to any other occupying

department unless it is a commercial department or a department not belonging

to the Government of Kerala  ( e.g., a department of the Central Government

or of a Municipality).  The Executive Engineer should calculate the portion

to be borne by a commercial department or a department not belonging to

121

the Government of Kerala pro rata in proportion to the accommodation actually

occupied.  Before a department which occupies only a part of a building
pays the taxes on it, or if payment cannot be delayed, as soon after payment

as  possible,  it  should  obtain  an  acceptance  from  every  other  department

which is liable to pay a share of the taxes.

121

CHAPTER V ]

  [ ART.  117

                  When a portion of a State building is occupied by a commercial department

or a department not belonging to the Government of Kerala, the proportionate

tax on the portion so occupied should be borne for the whole half-year by

the department which occupies it at the beginning of  the half -year.  If, later

on, that department vacates the portion within the half-year and if it is occupied

by another department within the same half-year, the tax for the portion will

be divided between the two departments in proportion to the periods of their

occupation and the necessary refund will be given to the first department.  If,

on the other hand, no other department  occupies the vacated portion within

122

the half-year the first department will not be entitled to any refund except to

the extent of any remission of tax that may be obtained on account of the

vacancy.

     (c)     As a  general rule, the tax paid by, or passed on to a department occupying

the whole or part of a building should be charged to the contingencies of

that department.  When, however, the whole or part of  the tax is paid by the

Public  Works  Department  or  another  department,  e.g.,  the  Excise

Department or the Forest Department as the department in administrative
control of the building [See Rules(4) and (5)  below]  the payment should

be charged to the maintenance estimate of the building.  When a building

is occupied by more than one department and the entire tax is paid by one

department under clause (b) above the payment should be debited to the

contingencies of the department paying the rent.

        (2)   Taxes on building occupied as residences.— (a)  The taxes on Government

buildings  occupied  as  residences  should  be  paid  by  the  Public    Works

Department or other department in administrative control of the building.

The portion representing taxes in the nature of property or house tax should
be treated as part of the cost of the maintenance of the building and the rest,

if any, should be recovered from the occupant.

122

CHAPTER V ]

CONTINGENT   CHARGES

            [ ART.  117

   (b)  The Government servant who occupies a Government building as a
residence  is  required  to  pay  the  service  taxes  recoverable  from  the

occupant whether rent is charged or not.  When a Municipal or other

local  tax  on  a  Government  building  has  to  be  borne  partly  by  a

Government servant who occupies part of the building as a residence

and partly by the Government, the Government will pay the tax in full in

the first instance and then recover from the Government servant the

amount payable by him.  The department which maintains a building

and pays the property tax will be held responsible for the due recovery

of  the service taxes payable by the Government servant who occupies

the whole or any part of the buildings as a residence.

        (3)    Amount of assessment.— (a) If the assessment of any Government property

to a local tax appears to be excessive, the Government servant who will have

to  pay  the  tax  on  behalf  of  the  Government  should  make  every  possible

effort to obtain redress under the ordinary municipal or local law.

            It is open to the Government to have recourse to the special provision of the

Municipal Taxation Act, 1881 (India Act XI of 1881) when no amicable settlement

can be reached with a Municipal Council located in the area in which the Act is

in force in regard to the assessment of any Government property, especially

when  the  property  is,  from  its  nature,  such  that  the  ordinary    principles  of

assessment of the tax in question cannot be applied to it, e.g., when the assessment

should  be  on  the  rental  value  but  the  property  is  such  that  it  is  difficult  to

conceive of its being let or impossible to form an estimate of the rent which the

Government could obtain by letting it. Any assessment of the Government

123

property to a Municipal tax which appears to be excessive and in regard to

which it proves to be impossible to obtain redress under the ordinary law
applicable to the tax should be reported to the Government in order that they

may  decide  whether  or  not  action  should  be  taken  under  the  Municipal

Taxation Act,1881 (India Act XI of 1881).

                  In regard to each assessment a certificate  stating  either that the assessment

is accepted or that all legal means have been, or are being taken, to get it

reduced should be sent to the Accountant General every year by—

      (i)    In the case of a building in the charge of the Public Works Department,

the Head of the Office occupying the building in consultation; when

necessary, with the Executive Engineer;

    (ii)  In the case of any other building, the departmental officer concerned,

and

124

  (iii)   In the case of land occupied by a Government Department and not

appertaining to a building, the Collector.

       (b)      The Executive Engineer who revalues the buildings belonging to the Government
during  quinquennial  revision  should  communicate  to  the  Heads  of  Offices
concerned who pay the property tax the revised valuation amount fixed by him
for the quinquennium simultaneously with his sending the revaluation statements
to the Municipality or the local body concerned irrespective of the fact whether
such revaluation involves reduction or increase in the existing assessments.

    (4)        Vacancy Remissions.– (a)  Whenever a Government building (residential or
non-residential)  is  likely  to  fall  vacant,  the  occupant  of  the  building
immediately before the actual vacancy occurs or the Head of Office to which
the occupant belongs should arrange to give notice of the vacancy on the
date  on  which  it  falls  vacant  direct  to  the  Executive Authority  of  the
Corporation or of the Municipal Council or of the Panchayat concerned, as
the case may be, and send a copy of the notice simultaneously to the Executive
Engineer to enable him to claim any permissible remission of taxes.  The Head
of the Office mentioned above should take similar action on the first day of
every succeeding half-year if the building is still vacant then.  The Executive
Engineer should claim remission of Municipal tax or local tax in respect of
every  vacancy  which  has  lasted  for  30  or  more  consecutive  days  under
Section 105 of the Kerala Municipalities Act, 1960 (Act 14 of 1961) or Section
107 of the Kerala Municipal Corporations Act, 1961 (Act 30 of 1961) or in

accordance with the relevant rules made under the Kerala Panchayats Act,
1960, as the case may be.  The Government servant who pays any tax in
respect of a building for a period during any part of which it has been vacant
should satisfy himself that any permissible remission of tax has been claimed
for the period during which that building was vacant.

          Similarly when a Government building (whole or part) is demolished or
destroyed, the department on whose register the building is borne should
immediately  give  the  requisite  notice  to  the  Municipality  or  Panchayat

STORES

CHAPTER  VI

STORES

Introductory

120.(1)    The term “stores” means all articles and materials (other than cash and documents)

which come into the possession of a Government servant for use in the public

Service. This term does not, however, include items like fuel, charcoal, dietary

products, etc. For fulfilling the duties and functions of the Various Departments

of the Government, “Stores” have often to be purchased.  This chapter contains

the general rules applicable to all Departments regarding purchase of stores

required for use in the Public Service. In regard to particular classes of articles

such  as  books  and  periodicals,  stationery  and  printing  stores,  clothing  and

liveries, etc., these rules will be supplemented by the instructions in the book of

Financial Powers issued by the Finance Department. In the case of Public Works,

Forest, Stationery, Police and other special Departments, those rules should be

supplemented by the special rules contained in the Codes and Manuals of the

Departments concerned, e.g., P.W.D Code, Forest Code, Stationery Manual,

Police Manual, etc. These rules will be supplemented by the provisions in the

Stores Purchase Manual wherever specific provisions are not made in these

rules.

          (2)    These rules and instructions also apply to the purchase of stores by Government

servants  on  behalf  of  local  bodies  and  of  local  funds  administered  by  the

Government,  if  such  purchase  is  authorised  by  Government.  Rules  and

Instructions regarding preferences or margin of preferences in respect of industries

having approved rate contracts, or purchase of products of indigenous or Indian

129

Industries or industries  within the State of Kerala or Public Sector Institution
etc., shall be applicable also in the case of purchases made by the Municipal

Corporations. These Rules and Instructions shall be followed by Heads of aided

schools while utilising Public Funds for the purchase of articles for their schools.

This will apply to purchases from Special Fees Fund also.

   [ ARTS.  121-122

Authorities Competent to Purchase Stores

121.      Expenditure on stores is included under contingent expenditure (except

where it is treated otherwise, e.g., stores relating to works expenditure)

and  is  therefore  subject  generally  to  the  rules  contained  in  Chapter  V

which govern such expenditure.

             A Government servant who is competent to incur contingent expenditure

may purchase direct from firms in India or through the agency of the Central

Purchase Organisation, or direct from manufacturers abroad, such stores as

he  requires  for  the  use  of  his  department  or  his  office  subject  to  Stores

130

Purchase  Rules  and  also  subject  to  the  usual  restriction  regarding  the

existence of  budget  appropriation. Such purchases made in India are also

subject to any money limits and other conditions prescribed generally or

with regard to specific articles or classes of articles (See Book of Financial

Powers).

Forecast of  Requirements

122.     A Government servant who has to purchase stores for the public service
should estimate his requirements for the year so far as they can be foreseen.

He should prepare an annual indent of stores in Form 13 in accordance with

the  instructions  contained  in Article  124.The  indent  should  show  the

approximate cost of articles to be purchased including incidental expenses

and should be got sanctioned by competent authority.  As far as possible a

purchasing officer should lay in sufficient stock during the cheapest season.

When necessary he should apply for advice as to the best time for making

purchases and assistance in obtaining tenders to Government servants of

other departments who are in close touch with the market for the articles
required and know the usual course of their price.  For example, it is usually

advantageous to buy foodgrains required for rations just after the harvest

and the Revenue Department is likely to be able to give useful advice and

assistance in regard to such purchases.  Articles which are likely to depreciate

130

CHAPTER V ]

STORES

   [ ARTS.  122-124

or deteriorate during storage should  not, however, be bought long in advance
of  requirements.  It  should  also  be  remembered  that  the  purchase  of  any

article in advance of requirements involves the locking up of Government

money and is not therefore desirable unless it is reasonably likely to prove

advantageous in regard to price.

Preparation of Indent

123.          At the end of each financial year, each department should realistically assess

its requirements of stores and equipments required during the next financial

year and prepare a list of the articles required.  The list may be prepared on

the  basis  of  the  consumption  during  the  previous  3  or  5  years  and  with

reference to factors, if any, which justify an increase or decrease compared

with the average.  The lists for each year should also be based on the budget

estimate  for  the  next  year  and  should  be  prepared  duly  allowing  for  the

carrying over of stock for at least one quarter of the succeeding year.  As

soon as the list is prepared the required sanction of Government or other

competent authority should be obtained for the purchase.  Particular care

should be taken to ensure that orders are placed only for quantities which

will be utilised within a reasonable time.

                                                Administrative Sanction

124.(i)   It is the duty of each purchasing officer to see that funds are available for

meeting the expenditure in respect of purchase of stores and administrative

sanction is secured before proceeding to make purchases.

131

      (ii)  Heads of Departments and other officers empowered  in this behalf are
competent to accord administrative sanction for all purchases upto the limit

of financial powers vested in them.  For purchases involving higher amounts

the sanction of Government is necessary.

Departments are empowered to accord administrative sanction for purchases
of other items upto  ` **10,000 at a time.  But this shall not enable them to
purchase luxury articles like refrigerators, radios, photographic equipments,

microscopes, generators, audio-visual equipments, motor cycles and scooters.

       (iv)    Administrative sanction for a project in which  the component items and

their cost are listed out in detail will be taken as equivalent to administrative

132

sanction for the purchase of such components.

         (v)   While issuing or recording administrative sanctions, mention should not be

made of makes, specifications, rate contracts and such other details relating

to the stores, the purchase of which is administratively sanctioned.

Purchase Sanction

125.(i)    All purchase proposals which do not fall within the powers of the Head of

Department will be considered by the appropriate Departmental Purchase
Committee.  The factual accuracy of the materials placed before the Committee

and the observance of the Rules in undertaking the various steps before,

bringing the proposals before the Committee will be the sole responsibility

of the Head of the Department.

      (ii)     While submitting recommendations to the Government for a purchase sanction,

the  Heads  of  Departments  or  other  purchasing  officers  should  furnish  a

certificate in the following form:–

              “Certified that the purchase of the goods proposed in this report has been

administratively  sanctioned  by  competent  authority  (here  mention  the

sanctioning authority with the Order No. and date) and that funds are available

to meet the expenditure during the current financial year”.

           (i)       Purchase of uniform for nursing sisters in all the hospitals in the State.

        (ii)     Purchase of books and periodicals in all departments involving less

than   ` 1,000* at a time.

              Note:—  For purchase of books and periodicals for any amount above
`  1,000*  simple  quotations  from  leading  book  houses  and  book
dealers may be called for and orders placed on the basis of those

competitive quotations.  Written undertaking should be obtained

from  the  selected  firms  to  the  effect  that  they  shall  supply  the

books and periodicals ordered; in time and in satisfactory condition.

         (iii)    Petty purchases of less than  ` 500* at a time.

                  Note:—  The  Director  of    State  Water  Transport  Department  is

               Quotations may be invited if the estimated value of the stores is below
` 10,000.  Copies of Quotation Notice regarding the general conditions of
the  supply,  specification  of  article,  etc.,  should  be  supplied  to  all  the

firms to whom the enquiries were/are sent.  A specimen form of Quotation

Notice is given in Annexure I. It is not obligatory to publish Quotation Notices

in the Gazette.  Short Quotation Notices as in Annexure II may, however, be

published in the newspapers if considered necessary.

        (b)  Tenders should be  invited, if the estimated value of the stores to be purchased

is  ` 10,000 or above.  Tenders should be obtained:—

134

     I.    By advertisement (Open Tender).

     II.   By direct invitation to limited number of firms   (Limited Tender).

     III. By invitation to one firm only (Single Tender or private purchase).

         I.  Open Tender.— (a)  The open tender system i.e.,  invitation to tender by public
advertisement, should be used as a general rule and must be adopted, subject

to the exceptions mentioned in paragraphs under ‘Limited Tender’ and ‘Single
Tender’, whenever the estimated value of the contract  is  ` 10,000 or more.
In all cases of open tender, it is essential that wide publicity is given to the

tender notification.  Short tender notices as in  Appendix V of the  Stores

Purchase Manual should be published in the Stores Purchase sheet of the

Kerala Gazette.  If the nature of the articles required is such that better results

can be obtained by advertisement, short  tender notices may also be  published

in one or more leading regional language news papers and also in one  or two

issues  of  a  leading  English  newspaper  published  in  India  having  wide

circulation in the area from where the supplies are normally obtained.

     (b)    For stores which are obtainable purely from Kerala e.g., charcoal,

firewood,  etc.,  publicity  may  be  given  by  advertisement  in  the
regional language dailies even if the value is less than ` 10,000.

  [ ART.  126

         (c)    In the case of purchases of heavy machinery, imported goods and other
stores which cannot be obtained without wide publicity at All India level,

the tender notices may be published in addition to their publication in the

Government Gazette, in the Indian Trade Journal, published weekly

from Calcutta by the Director-General of Intelligence and Statistics.

         (d)     In addition to the publication, the short tender notices should be sent

to all registered firms in the line and also to other reputed dealers.

          (e)      For the purpose of notifying dealers and contractors a list of approved

firms, both Indian and Foreign of known reliability should be maintained

in  the office of every purchasing officer.  The list should be prepared

commodity-war on the basis of the list of registered firms maintained

by Government in the Stores Purchase Department.  The list will be

examined and revised periodically.  Applications from firms received

by the several Departments for inclusion in the approved  lists should

be forwarded by them to the Stores Purchase Department.  There is no

objection to sending enquiries  to firms outside the approved list.

         (f)      There are items for which there are no lists of registered firms in the Stores

Purchase Department, e.g., bottles, earthenware jars, Ayurveda medicines,

food materials, etc.  In such cases when tenders are invited the Purchasing

Departments should  see that  notices are sent direct to all known suppliers,

particularly to reputed manufacturers and stockists and any others who

might ask  to be intimated especially when such notices are published

only in the Gazette and not in newspapers.

        (g)    The Heads of Departments and Offices may make arrangements with the

135

Superintendent, Government Presses to get printed sufficient number of
spare copies of Tender Forms as in  Annexure VI containing details of

specifications, conditions of supply etc., to be supplied to the indenting

purchasers.   To  facilitate  matters,  particulars  regarding  the  quality  are

quite essential.  The Heads of Departments will incorporate specifications

tender forms and short tender/quotation notices.  The Superintendent of

Government Presses will print and supply the spare copies of the tender

forms to the Officers concerned within 8 to 10 days of requisition from

the Heads of Departments.

         II.   Limited Tender.— The limited tender system may be adopted whenever the

estimated value of the order to be given in less than ` 10,000.

              The limited tender system  may also be adopted instead of the open tender

system  even  when  the  estimated  value  of  the  stores  to  be  purchased  is
above `  10,000 in the following cases:–

136

       (i)     When there are sufficient reasons for holding that it is not in the public

interest  to  call  for  tenders  by  advertisement;  in  every  such  case  the

purchasing officer must record the reasons and communicate them to the

Accountant-General, confidentially if necessary.

          (ii)        When  the  purchasing  officer  is  satisfied  that  there  is  serious  risk  or

inconvenience or loss to the public service by arranging the purchase by
the open tender system or when the article are urgently required; in every

such case the purchasing officer must place on record the nature of the

urgency and the reasons why a deviation from the general rule has been

rendered necessary.

         III.  Single  Tender.— (a) The single tender system may be adopted:–

         (i)         in the case of a small order when the articles required are of a proprietory

character and competition is not expected to be advantageous.  For this

purpose  a  small  order  means  an  order  of  the  value  of  which  does  not
exceed * ` 250 or, if more than one kind of article is ordered at one time the
total value of which does not exceed  * ` 500.

Sector Industries and Institutions will be purchased from them, exclusively,

without tenders for the first five years after they have gone into production,

the prices being fixed by negotiation.  Prior to such negotiation, the purchasing

authority should ascertain the normal market prices by enquiry from as large

a number of suppliers as possible.  If the price required by the State Government

Departmental Unit/State Public Sector Industry/Institution is over 25% above

the  normal  market  prices,  the  price  is  to  be  reviewed  and  decided  by

Government.

          (ii)   In the case of products of State Government Departmental Units/State

Public Sector Industries and Institutions which have been in production

for more than five years, tenders should be invited as laid down in this

Government Departmental Unit/State Public Sector Industry/ Institution,

a price preference of 10 per cent as against firms manufacturing outside

the State and 5 per cent as against firms manufacturing within the State.

Ascertainment of Surplus Stores

129.       Before orders are placed with private firms, the surplus stock or articles, if any,

available with other Departments of the Government should first be utilised,

irrespective of the cost at which it is available.  The following instructions

should be observed in regard to the utilisation of the surplus stores in the

Departments of the Government:–

     (a)   Each Head of a Department should circulate from time to time lists of all

usable  stores  found  surplus  to  the  requirements  of  his  Department  to

other Heads of Departments as soon as the surpluses are noticed.

     (b)   Every Head of  Department should see from the list received by him

under instruction (a) above whether he can utilise the stores available
with  the  other  Departments  before  he  places,  or  allowed  his

subordinates  to  place  orders  for  the  purchase  of  such  stores  in  the

open market, or submit proposals to the Government for such purchases.

Even in cases where no list has been received by him covering the

particular articles required by him, he should make enquiries of the

Heads  of  Departments  with  whom  such  stores  may  be  available

ordinarily.

139

        (c)      When  proposals  are  submitted  to  Government  or  any  authority

authorised by Government for according sanction to the purchase
of  any  stores  it  should  invariably  be  stated  whether  action  was

taken with reference to instruction (b) above and if so, with what

result.

Form of Tenders

130.         Every Officer who proposes to purchase materials by the open tender system
should obtain tenders in a prescribed form issued by him or on commercial
letter papers of the tendering firms.  For all purchases involving ` 10,000 or
more,  tender  forms  should  ordinarily  be  prescribed  and  issued  by  the
purchasing officer at prices according to the scale approved by Government.

  Note:– The United Kingdom Trades Commissioner in India should be supplied

with one copy each of the tender forms as are required by him, free of

cost  by  all  the  purchasing  departments  who  invite  tenders  for  the

140

purchase of stores.

The priced tender forms should contain the general conditions of tender and

a list of materials to be supplied and should be got printed in book form.  The

general conditions of tender are contained in Annexure VI.

          The following scales of prices (exclusive of Sales-tax) are prescribed by

Government for tender forms to be issued by Government Departments.

      (d)     Ordinarily duplicate copies of tender forms should be issued only to firms or

individuals who have purchased the original copy.  But in the case of special

tenders duplicate can be issued to applicants for reference even if they have

not purchased the original copy.  But in such cases care should be taken to

see that the tenders are submitted only in original copies.

(b)      In all cases of rates/running contracts priced tender forms are essential

irrespective  of  the  amount  involved  unless  otherwise  decided  by

Government (See also Article 141).

(c)     Free tenders (or quotations)  may be invited in all cases of limited tender or

single tender system.  In such cases, the tendering firms can submit their

tenders in their own commercial letter papers.

Invitation of Tenders

131.        Whenever tenders are invited, the procedure in the following rules should be

142

followed.  This procedure will apply to all Departments except those for

which special rules have been laid down in their Codes or Manuals.

        (a)   Before inviting tenders, every officer should estimate his requirements for

the  year  as  far  as  he  can  foresee  and  regulate  the  time  of  his  purchases

according  to  the  state  of  market  and  stock  position  of  stores  of      his

Department (vide Article 123).  A phased programme may be drawn up for

inviting  the    tenders  so  that  there  is  no  rush  of  tenders  at  any  time  and

priority is given to articles which are in urgent need.

          (i)    Tenders can be invited even during the previous financial year for

normal  and  recurring  supplies  likely  to  be  required  by  various

Departments in the succeeding year.  But actual financial commitment

should  be  entered  into  only  after  the  Budget  is  passed  by  the

Legislature.

        (ii)   In the case of requirement in bulk   or costly machinery for which
competitive quotations can be  obtained for forward delivery, tenders
should be invited well in advance of the requirements so that stock
purchases at prohibitive prices are avoided.

        (iii)  Rush  purchases  towards  the  end  of  the  financial  year  should  be
avoided.  Expenditure which might otherwise be postponed should
not be incurred in the last month of the financial year solely with a

142

CHAPTER VI ]

STORES

    [ ART.  131

view to prevent lapses of the budget grants.  Such rush purchases
have an undesirable effect in that the strict observance of the rules
regarding invitation of the tenders, proper scrutiny of offers etc.,
are rendered impossible at  such high pressure.  Hasty purchases
cannot but lead to waste, confusion and delay.

       (b)  The articles should properly be classified under different trade groups
according  to  the  approved  classification.    (See  Annexure  IV  to  this
Chapter).  Tenders should then be invited separately for each group.

(i)     The tenders should not be made unwieldy by including too many items

of different kinds of materials in the same tender.  Where purchases are

large one tender notice should normally contain only one kind or class

of articles.

       (ii)    Requirements should be correctly estimated.  After inviting tenders the

quantity should not be varied materially.  It is wrong economy to purchase

bulk quantities at retail prices.

         (iii)    Indents of  the different institutions or sections under the same Head

of Department should be classified and bulked into a single list.  They

need not be shown separately in the tender list or schedule.

   Example:–  Laboratory glassware is required for the Physics, Chemistry,

Botany  and    Zoology    Laboratories  of  a  College.    Each  of  these

Departments  should  not  invite  tenders  separately,  not  should  the

Principal invite tenders separately for each Department.  On the other

hand the requirements of all the four Departments should be properly

classified and bulked. If, for example, each of the four Departments

143

require 2 beakers  with spout 500 c.c. the quantity should be mentioned

as 8 numbers and this should occur only at one place in the tender

notice.

CHAPTER VI ]

  [ ART.  131

          (iv)    The names of stores should be arranged in a clear intelligible manner.

Alphabetical arrangement is desirable. Each item should be given correct

and adequate specifications.  Mere reference to a catalogue numbers

and mention of patent/brand names should be avoided.  For example,

“Frigidaire”  should  not  be    mentioned  where  the  requirement  is  a

refrigerator.

    (c)    The requirements of the same or similar materials should be consolidated and

tenders invited in order to secure the advantage of competitive prices for bulk

supply.  Tenders should not be invited by the same Department for the same

144

class of materials several  times during the same year.  Apart from losing the

advantage of bulk purchases, piecemeal purchases result in avoidable work

and delay.

      (d)    Tender specifications should be carefully and correctly drawn up so that there is

no ambiguity about the correct type, size, packing etc., of materials required.

There should be no room for changes in specifications after inviting tenders.

     (e)  (i)     Intending Departments should endeavour to adopt the Indian Standard

Specifications wherever available, and where such specifications have

not been laid down, should consistent with the requirements of safety,

security and end use of the stores, permit relaxation of standards having

regard to technical limitations in indigenous production.

         (ii)    In respect of articles purchased by Government, other things being equal,

preference  will  be  given  to  goods  bearing  Indian  Standards  Institution

certification mark.

           (iii)      Copies of tender notices issued by the Purchasing Officers will be sent

to the  Indian Standards Institution for information.

      (f)   (i)        Comprehensive specifications of plant, machinery and specialised  equipment

should be given with the terms “or similar” added wherever possible.

144

CHAPTER VI ]

STORES

                 [ ART.  131

             (ii)     Where there is lack of experience of any particular type of equipment and
full specifications cannot be furnished, preliminary enquiries should be

made in the     first instance and the offers got examined by the technical

experts  who  should  then  draw  up  comprehensive  specifications  for

inviting the formal tender.

            (iii)    Tenderers should be allowed to quote for all the items included in a tender or

a part  thereof.  They should also be allowed to make suitable alternative

offers.

     (g)     A  Purchasing Officer who invites tenders for the supply of stores may
exercise full discretion regarding the place of delivery to be specified in
the invitation of tender.  The conditions should as far as possible be such as
to give all tenderers equal opportunities of tendering at their lowest rates.
He may stipulate for delivery  c.i.f. or f.o.r. at an Indian Port or f.o.r. at the
place of despatch in India or f.o.r. destination or for free delivery  at the
receiving stores/office.  When tenders are invited for the supply of plant
and equipments and the successful tenderers is to erect the plant at site, the
appropriate conditions in regard to delivery at site should be included in the
invitation of tender or in the general specifications.

     (h)    Save as provided in Article 148(b) all articles required for use in the public

service shall be purchased on the condition that delivery shall be made in

India for payments in Rupees in India. Except in special cases, full payment

should not be made for any stores against shipping or railway documents,

and payment should be completed only after the Receiving Officer has taken

delivery of stores and found them to be satisfactory in every respect.
145
      (i)      In all cases of invitation of tenders, care should be taken to see that sufficient time

is allowed to the tenderers to submit their tenders. In fixing the date for the

receipt of tenders , the purchasing Officer should take into account the time

required for publicity, for the receipt of the tender forms by the tenderers  and the

preparation and despatch of the tenders. He may exercise his discretion about

      [ ART.  131

the last  date for the receipt of tenders keeping in mind the nature and supply

position of the articles required to be purchased.

      (j)      The following minima are suggested:-

        (i)      For ordinary stores which can be procured  from the Indian market—One

month.

         (ii)       For machinery and plant which have necessarily to be imported—Two

months.

            (iii)    For  heavy  equipments  involving  foreign  manufacture  of  plant  and

146

machinery, their  import and erection—Three months.

     (k)      The  invitation  should  also  specify  a  period  of  firmness  during  which  the

tenderers are to keep their rates firm.  The time fixed for firmness of offers

should be enough  to cover the normal delay expected in placing supply

orders after going through all the formalities.  It is necessary that regard
should be had to the fluctuating nature of the markets in fixing these periods.

Long periods of firmness such as 6 or 8 months should be avoided.  The

following periods of  firmness may generally be prescribed:—

            (i)      All ordinary items of stores—Two months.

        (ii)   Important tenders involving manufacture, supply and erection such as

heavy electrical    plants, machinery steel structures etc. —Three months.

         (iii)    For  stores which are in short supply in the country and the prices of

which are subject to violent fluctuations, a maximum period of one

month or even less may    be fixed.  A week or two is better.

         (iv)   It is important that in all cases decision regarding the selection of

offers are taken    promptly and acceptances communicated to, or

supply orders  placed with the    selected firms before the period of

firmness expires.

146

     [ ARTS.  131-132

     (l)     In all cases, tenders should be obtained in sealed envelopes.  In special cases
tenders in duplicate may be called for or even in triplicate.  The tender invitation
should include the general conditions of tender, and a list of the materials required,
each item carrying full specifications and special conditions, if any.  The tenderers
should  be  asked  to  superscribe  on  the  envelopes  containing  the  tenders  the
name and number of tender as well as their own name.  The advertisement
should specify the price of  tender forms and state the place where, the date on
which and the time when the tenders are to be submitted, and will be opened.
The tenderers or their representatives may be invited to be present at that time
to scrutinise the several competitive tenders received.

    (m)   Tenders shall be invited in India and when considered desirable also from

abroad for the supply of articles in order to obtain adequate publicity and to

ensure that the purchase is made to the best advantage.  These considerations

apply mainly to the categories of stores which have usually been obtained

in the past by import.

      (n)    The service of the Central Purchase Organisation (Director General of Supplies

and Disposals, New Delhi, the I.S.D., London and the I.S.M., Washington) may

be utilised to the extent necessary.  The rules for utilising the service of Central

Purchase Organisation are contained in Annexure V.

Earnest Money Deposit

132.         A cash deposit as earnest money should ordinarily be taken for every tender
involving  ` 10,000 or more and for  special tenders the amount being 1 per
cent (rounded to the nearest rupee) of the total cost of the articles tendered
for.  This is subject to a minimum of  ` 30, if 1 per cent  of the amount of the
tender falls below  ` 30.

147

                 In certain special cases, a lump sum earnest money may be prescribed with

reference  to  the  nature  of  articles  required  and  to  the  extent  of  possible

competition.

demanded in the tender notice.

Acceptance of Tenders

135.(1) (i)        In selecting the tender/tenders to be accepted the financial status and
previous performance, if any, of the tenderers should be taken into
consideration in addition to all other relevant factors.

                 Note:— When a tender which appears to be satisfactory is received from
an unknown firm, steps should be taken before any order is placed to
ascertain whether the firm is capable of executing the contract in a proper
manner.  If the result of enquiry proves satisfactory the order or a portion
of it may be placed with the firm.  If any firm is to be ignored on grounds of
unsatisfactory, performance in respect of a previous contract, the decision
should be taken by Government.

                  (ii)       The various tenders should be compared in respect of price, quality, terms
of delivery, terms of payment, etc., other conditions being equal the lowest
tender should be accepted; and in cases where the lowest tender is not
accepted the reasons therefor should be recorded [see also  item (v) below].

            (iii)    When there are two or more offers for an article at the same rate and
governed by similar conditions, the contract may be divided equally
among the tenderers provided they are all well-known.  Otherwise, the
previous contractor whose performance was satisfactory should  be
preferred.

 (iv)      In selecting offers the cheapness, etc., of each individual item should be

taken into account.

 (v)     In accepting tenders as above, producers and manufacturers in Kerala
should be given preference. Government Purchase Policy generally permits
a price preference upto 15 per cent or even upto 25 percent or even higher

in  special  cases,  for  indigenous  products  over  imported  stores.    The
following price preference may be allowed for products of private industries
within the State over the products made outside the State:-

       (a)      Fifteen per cent for industries, in which Government have taken

shares.

      (b)      Ten per cent for other industries.

        (c)        Fifteen per cent of Industries of Charitable Institution registered
under the Travancore-Cochin Literary, Scientific and Charitable
Societies Registration Act XII    of 1955, within the district of their
location.

152

         Note:— These price preferences are subject to a ceiling  of 25 per cent
over imported goods.  As far as possible purchases will be made locally
unless the prices are substantially higher and the quality unsatisfactory.
The  choice  will,  however,  be  subject  to  the  price  preference  limits
indicated above.

 (vi)      When the conditions regarding quality, price, terms of delivery, terms
of payment, etc., are equal, preference in making purchases should be
given in the following order:-

            Firstly:– to articles which are produced in Kerala;

            Secondly:– to articles which are produced in India in the form of raw
materials or are  manufactured in India from materials produced in India;

      Thirdly:– to articles wholly or partially manufactured in India from

imported materials;

            Fourthly:–to articles of  foreign manufacture held in stock in India;

            Fifthly:– to articles manufactured abroad, which need to be specially

imported.

           Note:— With the view to applying the principles of preference given
above, a purchasing officer who invites tenders for supplying stores

152

CHAPTER VI ]

STORES

  [ ARTS.  135-137

should instruct the tenderers to furnish information as to the country
of origin in the case of raw material, and as to both the country of
manufacture  and  the  country  of  origin  of  the  materials  used  for  a
manufactured article.

(vii)    As far as possible firm price offers should be preferred to offers
providing for variation.  Price variation conditions need be accepted
only in very special cases and in unavoidable circumstances.  In
the case of articles which are usually subject to price variation  the
standard  price  variation  clause  given  to Annexure  VII  should  be
included in the tender notice itself.

       (2)    The acceptance or rejection of a tender is a matter entirely within the discretion
of the officer responsible for the purchase of the material, but a superior authority
or the Accountant-General may require him to justify the manner in which he has

used his discretion and give his reasons for rejecting any tender.  No tenderer

has any right to be told the reasons for rejecting his tender, and reasons for

rejection should not be communicated to any tenderer.

136.      No Government servant shall deal with a tender in which he or any of his

relations  has  any  pecuniary  or  other  interest.    If  any  such  cases  comes

before him in the course of his official duties, he should refrain from dealing

with the case and should submit the case to the next higher authority for

passing orders, indicating at the same time that he is not dealing with the

case because of the interest.  The relationship for the purpose of this rule

will be as specified   in section 6 of the Indian Companies Act, 1956 (extract

given as Appendix XXIII to the Stores Purchase Manual).  If any violation of

this rule is detected it will be dealt with severely.

153

137.      When owing to inadequate publicity or some other reason no satisfactory

tender  is  received  in  response  to  an  invitation  to  tender,    fresh  tenders

should be invited and the invitation to tender should be specially brought to

the notice of all possible tenderers.  If considered desirable the services of

the  Director  General  of  Supplies  and  Disposals,  New  Delhi  may  be

requisitioned.

138.      When the total cost of the articles to be purchased at a time is beyond the

financial powers of the purchasing officer he should forward the tenders

received and other relevant records together with his recommendations to

the higher authorities or Government, as the case may be, for orders.

Communication of Acceptance

139. (a)   Save as provided in sub-paragraphs (d) to (f) below, when a tender has been

154

once  accepted  finally  such  acceptance  shall  be  communicated  to  the

successful tenderer in the most expeditious manner and in any case before

the period of firmness expires, if such period  of firmness exists. A formal

supply  order  should  also  be  placed  with  the  successful  tenderer

simultaneously. The supply order should furnish the description, quantity

and price of the articles to be supplied. It should also prescribe the terms of

delivery and the terms of payment. Clear despatch instructions should also

be given to the supplying firm.

       (b)    In cases where railway freight is to be borne by Government, the stores should

be got down by goods train. In exceptional cases, transport by passenger train,

lorry transport or by post may be resorted to, but the purchasing officer should

record the reasons for adopting such a course.

                Copies of the supply orders should be forwarded to the Accountant- General, to
the officer who actually receives the stores and to the Sales-tax and Income-tax
authorities. A standard form of supply order is given in Annexure VIII

                                        #   *      *      *      *       *      *

      (d)  When the supply of stores is subject to the condition that the Department
should produce Import License, formal supply order should be placed only
after receipt of the license.

Security and Agreement

140. (i) (a)   The Purchasing  Officer should arrange to take a security from the
successful tenderer for the due fulfillment of the contract equivalent to
5 per cent of the total value of the contract (rounded to the nearest
rupee) subject to a minimum of  ` 30 in case of 5 per cent value of
contract falls below  ` 30. All purchases costing below  ` 1000 will be
exempted  from  the  requirements  of  security  deposit  and  written
agreement subject to the condition that in such cases prices should be
agreed upon in writing as provided in Article 51 and that payment will
be made only after supplies are received, verified and taken to stock.
The security may also be taken in Bank guarantees from Scheduled
Banks (Annexure IX) and in any of the forms mentioned under Article
288.  The  personal  securities  of  two  persons  of  known  probity  and
substance may also be accepted in exceptional cases, when there are
special reasons for doing so.

             (b)    The government or any authority authorised by Government may, when
desirable, exempt a firm of established repute from the obligation to furnish
security in respect of all contracts or for a particular contract or class
of contracts made with any Department of Government.

          (c)    No security should be demanded or taken from any Government
Institutions or any institutions listed in Annexure III, which supply
stores. This provision will apply in the matter of purchase of stores
from Government of India undertakings as well.

155

                (d)       Small scale Industries, cottage industries and industrial Co-operatives
within the state which have been registered as such with the Industries
Department (Department under the control of the Director of Industries
and Commerce) on furnishing proof of such registration are exempted
from  furnishing security deposits against contracts for supply of Stores
manufactured by them provided that an officer of and above the rank
of Deputy Director of Industries and Commerce having jurisdiction
over  the  area  also  certifies  to  the  soundness  and  reliability  of  the

powers will be exercised by the Secretary, Kerala Khadi and Village

from 5-6-1975.]

               (e)         After a contract has been fulfilled and payment made, the security
deposit should be released or refunded to the contractor/Firm without
delay.  As a rule, the security deposit should be released or returned to
the contractor within a maximum period of  three months of the expiration
of the contract.  In all cases where there is guarantee for the goods
supplied the security deposit will be released only after the expiry of
the guarantee period.

156

            (f)       No fresh security deposit need be demanded from firms for extended
period of the rate contracts originally concluded with them.  The security
deposit obtained  against the original rate contract may be considered
as security for the extended period of the rate contract.  In all such
cases a supplemental agreement should be entered into with the rate
contract holder for the satisfactory fulfillment of the extended contract.
A standard form of supplemental agreement is given in Annexure XII.

        (ii)               In the matter of purchase of stores by the State Government Departments,
Small Scale Industrial Units sponsored by the National Small Industries
Corporation  Limited,  New  Delhi  and  in  respect  of  which  competency
certificates are issued by the Corporation will be exempted from payment
of  earnest money deposits and security deposits.  This will not, however,
apply in the matter of purchase of  Stores on rate or  running contract basis.

        (iii)            In case  the earnest money deposited by the successful contractor if any,
is less than the security deposit demanded the amount of earnest money
may be treated as part of security deposit and the balance amount may be

should be called for from the firm. The earnest money submitted by all
unsuccessful tenderers should also be refunded simultaneously.

                  (iv)       An  agreement  should  be  entered  into  with  the  successful  tenderer
embodying  the conditions of the order and providing for the necessary
penal  clauses  for  any  breach  of  the  conditions  of  the  contract.   A
standard  form  of  agreement  is  given Annexure  X.    In  the  case  of
purchases costing  above  ` 1000 the purchasing  officer shall forward
a draft agreement to the firms along with the supply  order directing
them  that  the  consignments  need  be  sent  only  after  executing  the
agreement.  If any firm despatch the goods before execution of the
agreement, they should be held liable for the demurrage charges, if
any.

         Note:— The agreements are liable to stamp duty but registration is

optional Standard forms of quotation notice, supply order, bank

guarantee and agreement are given in Annexures I, II, VIII, IX, X

and XI.

Rate and Running Contracts

141.        All stores of standard types other than those required in small quantities

only, which are in common and regular demand and the price of which are

not subject to appreciable market fluctuations may be purchased on the

basis  of  a  Rate  or  Running  contract,  whichever  is  most  suited  to  the

circumstances of  each particular case.

157
                  In the case of articles which cannot be stocked conveniently in the departmental

store with safety and convenience, the system of running contracts should be

adopted.  A running contract is a contract for the supply of an of approximate

quantity of stores at a specified price during a certain period .

               Running contracts may be settled for the supply of articles at intervals during a

whole year or a part thereof.  Dietary articles, firewood, charcoal, raw materials

  [ ART.  141

for Ayurvedic medicines etc., come under this group.  In settling running contracts

all the rules relating to the ordinary contracts like invitation of tenders, earnest

money etc., should be followed, and in addition, special provision should be

made to safeguard Government interests and to ensure regular supplies.  It is

important that for all running contracts, tenders with earnest money should be

invited irrespective of the amount involved.

              A rate contract is a contract for the supply of stores at specified rates

during  the  period  covered  by  the  contract.    No  quantities  are  usually

mentioned  in  the  contract,  and  the  contractor  is  bound  to  accept  any

158

order which may be placed upon him  at  the  rates specified  within  the

contract period.  As a reciprocal consideration the Government undertakes

or order from the contractor all stores under the contract which are required

to be purchased subject to certain reservations for submitting prices to

competition  and  for  deciding  the  contract  between  one  or  more

contractors.    Rate  contract  should  be  settled  for  such  articles  as  are

required frequently by many Departments during the course of an year

for  which  the  quantity  cannot  be  forecast.    Rate  contracts  also  may  be
settled for one year or shorter definite period.  Indenting Officers can draw

their requirements direct from the contractors as and when required.  Steel

furniture, Steel cupboards and  M.T. Batteries, Sewing Machines, etc., are

some of the items coming under this group.

              Running contracts may be settled by Heads of  Departments and Departmental

Purchase Committees, but rate contracts will be settled by the Stores Purchase

Department only.

            The Director General of Supplies and Disposals, New Delhi is concluding

every year rate and/or running contract for a number of articles. Purchasing

Officers can avail themselves of these contracts, wherever it is economical

and easier to do so. They should keep themselves conversant with the rules

158

   CHAPTER VI ]

STORES

          [ ARTS.  141-143

and  procedure  of  the  Director  General  of  Supplies  and  Disposals  Rate
Contracts. The Stores Purchase Department is also concluding every year

rate contract for a number of articles. In respect of  purchases as per rate

contracts settled by the Director General of  Supplies and Disposals and the

State Government, purchase sanction from Government is not necessary,

even  if  the  value  of  the  purchase  exceeds  the  purchase  powers  of  the

Purchasing Officer provided that it is specified while issuing administrative

sanction, that the purchase will be made as per Director General of Supplies

and Disposals/State Rate Contracts. In such cases, the selection of the type

and make of the articles to be purchased will be made by the Purchasing

Officer. It is not necessary to mention the name of the firm or description of

stores etc., in the administrative sanction issued for the purchase.

            In the case of items for which rate/running contracts settled by the Stores

Purchase  Department  exist  or  a  running  contract  settled  by  the  Head  of

Department exists, it is obligatory for Government Departments to avail

themselves of those contracts. The agreement form to be used in the case of

running/rate Contract is contained in Annexure XI.

Negotiated Contracts

142.      When owing to greater promptitude of supply, by particular agencies of
special manufacture of some articles by certain firms, substantial economy
can  be  effected  by  deviating  from  the  tender  system,  officers  may,  after
negotiation  purchase  direct  such  articles  from  the  firms  or  agencies
concerned. This rule will apply only to patents and specialities to which
tender system cannot be applied with advantage (vide also Article 126).

159
Examination of contracts by the Accountant General

143.       The Accountant General in the exercise of his audit functions will examine
contracts settled by the departments and report to the Government the facts
of any case that come to his notice, in which competitive tenders where not
invited though they should have been invited under the rules or a tender
other than the lowest was accepted without sufficient jurisdiction, or any

other materials irregularity which has been committed in connection with a
contract.

Insurance of Government Property

144.        In the case of goods imported from abroad, insurance charges are payable by
Government, when the purchase price includes cost, insurance and freight of the
goods as delivered at any Port of Entry  in the State.  In f.o.b. or f.a.s. contracts
also insurance charges are payable by Government.  In all cases of contracts
where the supplying firm does not undertake insurance at its cost, the purchasing
officer should arrange for insurance himself against risks in transits such as loss,
damage, etc.

160

Insurance  is  essential  in  the  case  of  fragile  goods,  costly  machinery,
equipments,  delicate  machines  and  instruments  and  such  articles  which
deteriorate or otherwise becomes useless in transit.

Claims in respect of Imported Stores, lost or damaged

145. (i)   Purchasing Officers should see that in the case of loss or damage of imported

stores,  claims  are  promptly  made  against  the  shippers,  the  landing  and
clearing  contractors  of      the  supplies,  according  to  circumstances  or  the
Marine  Insurance  Company. A  loss  will  be  chargeable  against  Marine
Insurance   only when the responsibility for the loss or damage can not be
fixed  on the shippers, the landing contractors or the suppliers and recoveries
should be made accordingly. In any case, loss or damage has to be reported
promptly to the authorities concerned.

     (ii)   The report of loss or damage should show the particulars contained in the
instructions in the packing account, namely description of stores, details of
numbers and, where necessary, sizes and quantities, and when articles are
missing the gross weights of packages as received. In all cases  where     defects
noticed can be rectified locally  the probable cost of such local repairs shall
be  specified.  “Details  of  Recoveries”  already  effected  or  proposed  to  be

160

CHAPTER VI ]

STORES

               [ ARTS.  145-147

effected should also be mentioned. If no recovery has been made the fact
and reasons therefore should also be reported.

      (iii)   Marine Insurance does not cover risks after the movement when  the stores
leave the ship’s side, i.e., during landing, and it is therefore essential that
brittle stores such as stoneware pipes, R.C. pipes, glassware, etc., should be
landed at places of safety. Such stores should be landed at the ports only
when the risk of breakage is at a minimum. Indenting Officers should clearly
indicate in there indents whether any of the indented articles should be so
delivered.

      (iv)   In all cases in which stores from foreign countries are purchased  arrangements
shall be made to obtain three sets of documents. One set shall be caused to be
forwarded at the earliest possible date to receiving agents or clearing agents if
such agents are appointed; one set will be caused to be similarly sent to the
indenting officer and the third set to the Secretary, Stores Purchase Department
or  the  Head  of  the  Department.  On  receipt  of  the  shipping  documents,  the
indenting officer will issue necessary  instructions to the receiving agents in the
matter of transmission of  packages, etc., copies of such correspondence being
simultaneously forwarded to the Secretary, Stores Purchase Department or
the Head of the Department.

          Insurance on Railways or Lorry Transport or Inland Water Transport

146.       When the terms of delivery accepted by the Purchasing Officer are ex-factory or

ex-godown  or  f.o.r./f.o.b.  place  of  despatch,  the  charges  for  onward

transmission including freight and insurance have to be borne by Government.

Insurance of articles supplied from sources in India is optional, but in all cases in

which damage is likely insurance is advisable.

161

Receipt and Verification of Stores

147.(i)     The Officer authorised to receive stores should himself verify the articles

received with reference to the approved samples, if any and take them to

stock soon after they are received.  Any articles which is not new, or which

is different from those ordered for or which is damaged or defective in any

respect should not be accepted.

        (ii)     Stores which arrive by ship or railway or lorry or any other mode of transport

should be taken delivery of immediately after arrival to avoid demurrage etc.

Sanction of Government is necessary to pay demurrage, subject to however, to

the powers delegated to the Purchasing Officers.

162

      (iii)    Any loss, shortage or damage of any defect noticed on checking stores

should be promptly brought to the notice of all concerned.  Any claim for

loss, etc., should be preferred on the suppliers or transporting agents or

insurance company, as the case may be, immediately after the stocks are

received.

         (iv)     Heads of Departments can accept late supplies after recording the reasons

therefor upto two months after the prescribed date of delivery.  For further
period, in the case of purchases costing below ` 5 lakhs, the orders of the
Secretary to Government of the concerned Department should be taken
and in the case of purchases costing above  ` 5 lakhs, the proposals should
be sent to the concerned Departmental Purchase Committee.  Director of
Printing and Stationery can accept late supplies upto 3 months in respect of
purchases for which he is competent to sanction.  The Director of Health
Services can accept late supplies upto four months provided no loss on
account of such extension of time is incurred by Government.

Payment for Stores

148.(a)  (i)      For stores purchased in India.—  As a general rule, payment for supplies
is not permissible unless stores have been recieved, verified, and taken to
stock and provision for the observance of this rule should ordinarily be
made in all contracts for the supply of goods.

                 (ii)       Payment prior to verification of quantity  and quality of material is
permissible only in very exceptional cases in which the operation of

162

  CHAPTER VI ]

STORES

   [ ART.  148

the rule in the above paragraph might result in hard- ship, as for
example, when costly stores are ordered from a distant firm and
delay in payment is anticipated.  In such cases a part of the cost of
the consignments (not exceeding 90 per cent) to a distant firm may
be paid in advance on receipt of the railway receipt for despatch or
bill of loading provided the firm or contractor  is of well-known
standing and provided an agreement is taken before-hand, with the
contractor or firm to secure Government against all loss in the event
of materials being found short or defective on checking.

                  (iii)      In every exceptional cases, payment upto the full value against proof of
despatch may be made with the prior sanction  of Government. *Heads
of the Departments may effect 100% payment in very exceptional cases,
if the amount involved is less than  `  5,000 (Rupees five thousand
only) and the conditions mentioned in sub-rule (ii) above are satisfied.

            (iv)     The Officer who maintains the stock register must himself receive the
new stock.  Whenever a new purchase has been sanctioned and the
bill for drawing the money required is ready, it must be forwarded to
the officer entrusted with the maintenance of the stock register, who
should certify on the office copy of the bill that the new purchase in
question has been duly taken on to the stock account.  In those rare
cases in which it is not possible to receive stock before payment is
made, e.g., when articles are received by rail or post and payment is
made against documents, the officer-in-charge of stock accounts should
verify the new stock or receipt and furnish a  certificate of verification
which should be filed with the office copy of the bill concerned.

163
              (v)       Payment should ordinarily be made immediately after the stores are taken
to stock.  In no case should the payment be delayed for more than thirty
days from the date of receipt of stores.  If in any case delay in payment is
anticipated, the officer who is competent to make payment should intimate
the supplier concerned the reasons for such delay.

payments  (advance/final)  for  release  of  railway  receipts/shipping
documents  are  made  through  Banks.    In  exceptional  cases  where  the
stamped receipts of the firms are not received for the payments (in advance)
the unstamped receipt of the Bank (i.e. counterfoils of pay-in-slips issued
by the Bank) alone may be accepted as a valid proof for the  payment made.

  Note:— It is important that payment of bills should be made as expeditiously
as  possible  after  their  presentation,  as  otherwise  claims  for  interest
might arise ending in litigation. Such a contingency should be avoided.

164

      (b)      Payment for foreign purchase.— (i) Payments should be made in Rupees in

India.  Payment in any other currency and in any other country requires prior

sanction of Government.

               (ii)       Payment to firms abroad is arranged by the Accountant General through
the State Bank of India or any other bank on production of invoices, etc.,
supported by the certificates of the inspection agents, if any.  The invoice
received by the Purchasing Officer will be transmitted to the  Accountant-
General  after  counter-signature  by  competent  authority  with  the  stock
certificates, and the head of debit noted thereon.

               (iii)       Payment for supplies arranged by the  Accountant General through by
India  Stores  Department,  London  or  the  India  Supply  Mission,
Washington will be made in accordance with the terms of payment
agreed to by those bodies with the contractors. All such payments will
be arranged by the Accountant General.

                (iv)       In respect of foreign orders in which payment of a portion or full value
of the articles against shipping document or on arrival of the goods at
the  port  is  stipulated  in  the  contract,  under  proper  authority,  such
payments will be authorised by the Accountant General immediately
on receipt of information from the Purchasing Officer that the documents
have been received by the Bank from the suppliers or that the goods
have arrived at the port. The balance value, if any, will be arranged to

invoices  and  which  have  to  be  authorised  for  payment  after
verification of the materials by Departments, the officers concerned
should see that the materials are verified immediately on receipt
and that requisitions to the Accountant General for the payment of
the balances withheld are issued not later than a month from the
date of receipt of the materials.

          (vi)     In cases in which there is no agreement regarding payment in advance,

payment will be arranged only after the articles have been actually received

and brought to account.

            (vii)     In the case of advance payments to be made with order or during the

course of manufacture or before despatch of materials prior sanction

of Government is necessary.

           (viii)          Since payments in any foreign currency require the sanction of
Government of India no Purchasing  Officer should make any
commitments to pay in foreign currency before obtaining such
sanction.

          (ix)         The firms will produce stamped pre-receipted invoices in all cases where
payments  (advance/final)  for  release  of  railway  receipts/shipping
documents  are  made  through  Banks.  In  exceptional  cases  where  the
stamped receipts of the firms are not received for payments (in advance)
the unstamped receipt of the bank (i.e., counterfoils of pay-in-slips issued
by the Bank) alone may be accepted as a valid proof for the payment made.

Stock Accounts

149.(1)   The head of an office or any other officer who is entrusted with stores of any
kind should take special care in arranging for their safe custody.  He should
also maintain  suitable stock accounts or inventories for the stores in his

custody with a view to preventing loss to the  Government through  theft,
fraud, negligence or accident, and to making it possible to check the actual
balance with  the book balance and the expenditure on stores at any time.  It
is  important that each item of receipt and issue (or disposal) of stores should
be recorded concurrently as it occurs in the registers.

        (2)   The form of the stock account has to be settled with  reference to the nature
of  stores,  the    frequency  of  transactions  and  the  special  requirements  of
each department.  The same form of stock account would not be suitable
both for consumable articles such as dietary stores kept for use in a hospital
or jail and also for  ordinary office furniture.  Ordinarily each office should
keep  its  stock  account  or  accounts  in  the  form  and  according  to  the
instructions laid down in any general or special orders of the Government
which apply to the departments concerned or in the departmental manual,
code or orders.  If no such forms and instructions are  available, or if  they are
available but a competent authority has held that they are defective, then the
stock accounts should be kept in accordance with the instructions in Articles
151 and 152 below.

   *(3)    In the case of departments (other than those rendering monthly compiled
accounts  to  the Accountant-General  under  the  P.W.D.  system)  where
consumables  (other  than  items  debited  to  office  expenses)  are  purchased
and/or where non-consumable articles are purchased centrally for distribution
among Subordinate Officers/ private parties, the officers listed in Appendix
2A should, on or before the 30th June every year, forward to the Accountant-
General consolidated stores and stock accounts of the departments for the
immediately preceding financial year.  Machinery, tools, equipments etc.,
purchased  by  such  officers  for  exclusive  use  in  their  offices  need  not  be
included in the consolidated stores and stock accounts.

(c)     Books, forms and stationery.

      (a)      Stock  accounts  of  raw  materials  and  expendible  stores.—  The
stock accounts required on account of raw materials and expendible
stores include day-books of receipts and issues for recording the
transactions as they take place and a ledger for each kind of article
showing the receipts, issues and balances.  If no specific forms and
rules have been prescribed for a department. Forms 16 and 17 should
be used for this purpose.

    (b)     Stock account of office furniture and stores.— Every Head of Office
should maintain a stock account of furniture and all other stores (except
books, forms and stationery) in Form 18 showing the number received,
the number issued or disposed of (by transfer, sale, loss, etc.) and
the balance in hand for each kind of article separately.  When an
office is large and the furniture, etc., is kept in several rooms, the
Head of the Office may have an inventory of the furniture, etc., kept
in each room exhibited in the room and kept up-to-date in order to
facilitate the annual verification of stock and fix the responsibility
for any loss that may occur.

   (c)     Stock account of books, forms and stationary.— Every Head of

Office should also maintain stock accounts for forms and stationery

in accordance with the rules in the Stationery  Manual and also a

register in Form 19 of the books belonging to the office.

Note 1:— The term ‘books’ will include catalogues, periodicals etc.

Note 2:— Government libraries and museums should maintain catalogues

Valuation of Stores in Stock Accounts

151.         When a period inventory is maintained, the value recorded in it for any item

should  not  materially  exceed  its  current  market  value.    The  Head  of  the

Department  concerned  should  issue  necessary  instructions  to  ensure  that

the stores are valued with reasonable  accuracy and that the rates adopted

are reviewed at suitable intervals by a competent authority.

152.       Stores should be issued as far as possible on indents passed by an officer

who has been duly authorised to pass them.  Every issue should be recorded

168
in the stock account at the time when it is made.

In respect of transactions between a main store and the sub stores under it,

it is essential that there should be complete reconciliation of the issues from
the main store and the receipts in the subsidiary stores to which issues are
effected from the main store.  The inspecting officers and other departmental
officers should specially bear this point in the mind while conducting stores
inspection.

Inspection of Stores

153.        No Government servant should hold  stores in stock in excess of the quantity
likely to be required for a reasonable period.  To ensure that  this rule is
observed,  a  responsible  officer  of  the  Department  should  inspect  all
perishable stores once in each half-year and all the other stores once a year
unless there is sufficient reason (which should be recorded) to the contrary.
If he considers that any of the stores inspected is obsolete or in (excess of
reasonable  requirement,  he  should  submit  a  report  to  the  competent
authorities either to sanction the write off  of a loss of cash equivalent to
their value or to transfer the surplus stores to other Departments/ Offices
which may     require them and also to include them in the list of surplus
stores.  These authorities should then pass orders as to the disposal of such
stores.    Heads  of  Departments  and  Offices  should  also  review  the  stock
position of the various stores under them as on 31st March of a year in the

month of May of the succeeding financial year and take steps to dispose of
materials  which  have  become    unserviceable  or  are  likely  to  become
unserviceable in the near future.  A copy of each of such review should be
sent  to  Government  in  the  administrative  Department  and  the  Finance
Department so as to reach Government before 15th June of each year.

Unserviceable and Surplus Stores

154.        Subject to any special orders issued by Government as applicable to individual
cases, stores which are found to have become unserviceable in the ordinary
course or by fair wear and tear may be condemned by the authority competent
to  authorise  replacement  by  purchase.    Full  reasons  for  condemning  such
unserviceable stores must be recorded on such orders together with a certificate
to the following effect:—

                “Certified that I have personally satisfied myself that each item written off in

these proceedings has become unserviceable in the ordinary course through
proper usage or by fair wear and tear.”

    Note:—  Separate sanction for write off of losses is not necessary where the

stores are bodily present.  It is only in such cases where the stores are

missing (as in cases of fire, theft, etc.) that formal sanction for write off

of losses will be necessary.

155. (a) The authority referred to in the preceding Article may also condemn stores

found  at  any  time  to  have  become  unserviceable,  otherwise  than  in  the

ordinary course or by fair wear and tear (e.g., by avoidable carelessness or

neglect, misuse, etc.) but this should not be done until after their value has

been  written  off  by  the  authorities  competent  to  write  off  a  loss  of  cash

169

equivalent to their value or the recovery of the balance has been effected
from the persons responsible .

              The value of stores for purpose of Articles 153 to 157 shall be taken to be

their book value where priced accounts are maintained, and where these are

non-existent or suspect, their “replacement value”, i.e., market value (at the

time of issue of sanction for the disposal/write off) of such new articles or

articles of similar nature.

          (b)  When any stores become unserviceable or depreciate otherwise than in the

ordinary course or by fair wear and tear, their value or the amount of such

depreciation,  as  the  case  may  be,  should  be  treated  as  a  loss  to  the

Government within the meaning of Article 297 and the procedure prescribed

therein should be strictly followed in reporting any such loss (See also Article

301).

170

156.          Stores  which  have  become  unserviceable  otherwise  than  in  the  ordinary

course or by fair wear and tear, should never be condemned in the same order

along with stores which have become unserviceable in the ordinary course

or by fair wear and tear.  Separate orders should be passed dealing with the

stores  in  each  of  the  two  classes-each  order  should  indicate  the  causes

leading to the stores having become unserviceable or obsolete and should

state how the condemned stores are to be disposed of, i.e., whether by sale

or by destruction, since stores should be condemned only when they cannot

be made serviceable by repairs at a reasonable cost.  A copy of such order

should be endorsed to the Accountant-General.  Condemned stores which

are quite worthless should be ordered to be destroyed. Other condemned

stores should as far as possible, be sold under the orders of the authority

competent to write off a loss of cash equivalent to their value and the sale

proceeds credited to Government.  The sale proceeds should not be taken

into account for determining the value of the stores as this amount is to be

treated as a miscellaneous receipt of the department concerned.  The Head of

the Office should record full particulars regarding all condemned stores in
suitable lists from which their disposals can be checked.

  Note:— In all cases where the stores are condemned the orders should be

supported by a survey report in Form  21.

156A.   Where articles are to be sold by public auction, the Head of the Office or any
other Gazetted Officer authorised by the Head of the Office should invariably

attend the auction and record the final bids.  Wide publicity should be given

before conducting the auction and the form of publicity should conform to

the rules prescribed in the departmental manuals.  In the absence of any

provision in this regard in the departmental manuals, the officer sanctioning

the sale shall decide the nature of publicity to be given, with due regard to

the assessed value of the articles to be sold.

          2.  A register in Form No. 20 should be maintained by the officer authorised to

conduct the auction and all the columns in the register should be filled up at

each stage of the auction.  A separate page or folio should be set apart in the

register for each auction.

          3.    An earnest money deposit at the rate of 1 per cent of the assessed value of
the articles to be sold subject to a minimum of  ` 10 may be realised from the
intending bidders before the commencement of auction.  The earnest money

shall be returned to the bidders immediately after the auction except in the

case of successful bidder, in whose case the amount will be adjusted against

the sale price due from him.  In the event of the highest bid being found

unreasonably  lower  than  the  assessed  value  of  the  articles,  the  officer

authorised to conduct the auction may cancel the auction, in which case the

earnest  money  deposited  by  the  bidders  including  that  by  the  highest

bidder  shall  be  refunded  instantly,  obtaining  proper  acquittance  in  each

case.    While  arranging  re-auction,  the  Head  of  the  Office  shall  consider

whether greater publicity is needed in order to attract more participants at

171

the re-auction.  The procedure for the re-auction will be same as for the

original auction.

          4.    Soon    after  confirmation  of  the  auction  by  competent  authority,  the

successful bidder shall deposit the bid amount in full less earnest money

deposit.  Articles sold at the auction shall on no account be retained in the

office for long.  The period for which they will be kept and that too at the risk

and loss of the successful bidder may be notified before the conduct of the

auction and the written consent of the bidder therefor, obtained.  In the event

of failure to take delivery of the articles after the stipulated time, the articles

may either be arranged to be re-auctioned or released to the original bidder

himself  on  realisation  of such  retaining fee as may be  reasonable in each

case.   In the event of re-auction the successful bidder at the previous auction

shall forfeit the amount remitted by him.  This position may be brought out

clearly in the notice relating to the auction and the written consent of the

172

bidders to this condition obtained prior to the auction.

          5.   The Head of Office or any other authorised officer should be present when

the articles sold are released, his presence being most essential when the

release of the articles takes place sometime after the auction or when it involves

processes such as weighments etc.  A sale account in Form No.    20-A should

be prepared and signed by the officer who supervised the auction.  If the

articles are released in the presence of an officer other than the one who

supervised the auction, the entries in the sale account should be attested by
the dated signature of such officer.

157.        Stores remaining in stock for over a year should be considered surplus unless

there is sufficient reason to treat them otherwise.

               The previous sanction of the competent authority should be obtained for

the sale of stores regarded as surplus.

If on verification it is found that stores are held in surplus the Head of Office

should  make  out  a  list  of  such  surplus  stores  with  essential  details  and

forward it to the Head of the Department (See also Articles 128 and 129.)

             Government departments should be treated as priority indentors for these

surplus stores.  No sale of these stores should be made until it is assured that

no Government Department requires them.

172

CHAPTER VI ]

STORES

                 [ ARTS.  157-158

   Note:— The procedure detailed in Article 156A should be followed when
surplus  stores  are  disposed  of.   A  report  of  the  surplus  stores  for

disposal should also be prepared in Form 22 and signed by the Head of

Office or other gazetted officer authorised by the Head of the Office.

The entries in the Sale Account should be compared with this report

before the officer who supervised the auction, signs the Sale Account.

Verification of Stores

158.       All stores should be verified periodically in the manner prescribed for each
Department and at least once a year.  In the Stationery Department a complete
physical verification of the stock need, however, be made every two years
only.

                Subject to any special rules or orders, a Government servant who is in charge of

any expendible stores or raw materials should check them at least once a year

and send a verification report to the controlling authority.  The latter should

also check the stock account when inspecting the office.

               Furniture and other office stores should be verified at least once a year.  If the
office is a large one and the Head of office cannot do the whole verification

himself without undue inconvenience, he may entrust it, or such part of it as

he thinks fit, to a gazetted officer serving under him or to the head ministerial

officer  of  the  office,  but  the  Head  of  the  Office  will  be  held  personally

responsible for the proper maintenance of the stock account and correctness

of the verification report whether he conducts the verification himself or

gets it done by some one else.  The Head of the Office should sign a certificate

of check after each verification and submit it to the controlling authority, if

173

there is one.

                 The verification of stores prescribed in this article should never be entrusted—

          (i)     to a low paid subordinate ; or

          (ii)     to the custodian, the ledger-keeper or the accountant responsible for
the  stores  to  be  verified,  or  to  a  person  employed  under  the
custodian, the ledger-keeper or the accountant; or

          (iii)      to  any  one  who  is  not  conversant  with  the  classification  and
nomenclature of the particular classes of stores to be verified and
the  connected  technique.

                  As far as possible, the verification of large stocks and stocks of important
stores should be entrusted to a responsible officer who is independent of
the superior executive officer in charge of the stores .  Stores should always
be verified in the presence of the officer responsible for the custody of the
stores or of a responsible person deputed by him to watch the verification.

174

  Note:— The following procedure should be observed for the audit of the

accounts of furniture in the Raj Bhavan:-

                   An annual certificate of verification should be sent by the Military Secretary
to the Governor so as to reach the Accountant-General, Kerala on or before
the 31st July of each year stating that all furniture has been inspected and
checked with the stock list maintained and that he is satisfied (i) that all new
supplies up-to-date have been correctly brought on to the inventories, (ii)
that the inventories are correct in all respects, (iii) that the articles in stock
agree    with  the  inventories,  (iv)  that  sale  proceeds  have  been  properly
accounted for, (v) that sanctions of competent authority exist for all articles
written  off  the  inventory,  and  also  (vi)  the  articles  of  furniture  are  being
properly maintained and are kept in serviceable order.

                Unserviceable articles may be sold and written off the stock list at the discretion
of  the Governor, but no valuable articles should be sold unless they are certified
to be worn out, or have become useless, independently of considerations of
personal taste.  The amount realised from the sale of unserviceable articles should
be credited to State Revenues.

159.         Apart from the periodical verification of stores by the Heads of Offices and
other  Government  servants  authorised  in  this  behalf  under  the  preceding

174

   CHAPTER VI ]

STORES

       [ ARTS.  159-161

article,  surplus  check  of  stocks  and  stores  should  be  undertaken  by  the
superior officers in each Department at     intervals at least once a year so as
to  ensure  that  stores  are  properly  maintained  and  accounted  for.    It  is
necessary that the inspection should be a surprise one; but the check may
be confined to important items.  The results of such surprise checks should be
reported to the Government in the concerned administrative department with
the  recommendation,  if  any,  of  the  inspecting  officer  so  as  to  enable  the
Government  to  take  prompt  and  adequate  action  wherever  necessary.   The
results  of  the  surprise  inspections  and  the  orders,  if  any,  passed  should  be
communicated to the Accountant-General by Government in the Administrative
Department.

160.       Whenever an officer who is entrusted with the custody of stores in an office is
transferred, the relieving officer should verify the stock of stores with the stock
accounts certify on the stock accounts as to the correctness of the stock taken
over and report the result of the verification to his immediate superior.  For the
purpose of this rule the Government servant entrusted with the custody of the
stores is ordinarily the Head of the Office, but in a large office  he may delegate
this duty to a gazetted assistant, manager or recognised store-keeper.  When he
has done so, the verification prescribed in this Article need only be made, unless
otherwise ordered in any case, when a Government servant to whom the duty
has been delegated is transferred and the result of the verification should always
be placed before the Head of the Office.  In spite of any such delegation, the
Head of the Office still will be responsible for furnishing the certificate prescribed
at the foot of the various contingent bills, etc., stating that the articles billed for
have been brought into account, and for exercising a general control  so as  to
ensure that the stores are properly safeguarded and the stock accounts properly
maintained.

175

Discrepancies found on Verification of Stores

161.        A deficiency detected during a verification of stores may be due to:

(i)    incorrect or careless accounting;

(ii )  loss arising from fraud, theft or negligence; or

(iii)  an unavoidable cause, e.g., wastage, shrinkage, spilling, etc., in the case
        of  stores which are subject to them.

                The Head of the Office or institution concerned should  fully investigate the
causes of any deficiency and send a full report on it to the controlling authority
along with the verification report.  If he holds that any loss caused to the
Government through a deficiency is due to misconduct or culpable negligence
on  the  part  of  any  Government  servant  concerned,  he  should  add  his
recommendation as to how the loss should be made good by recoveries from
him.    The  controlling  authority  should,  after  such  examination  and
investigation as the importance of the case warrants, issue or obtain from the
competent  authority,  an  order  to  write  off  the  deficiency  from  the  stock
accounts.  On receipt of this order the deficiency should be charged in the
stock accounts with a note quoting the authority.  If any recovery is ordered,
a  note  should  be    recorded    in  the  stock  accounts  when  each  amount  is
actually recovered.

176

                   Any excess detected during stock-taking should, after investigation, be entered
in the stock accounts at once as a receipt with the remark “excess found on stock
verification”. No special orders are necessary for this.

           In the Annual Administration Report sent to Government the Head of the

Department should furnish information as regards :

   (i)        The condition in which stock registers are maintained in  his office and

the offices subordinate to him.

  (ii)      Result of periodical verification of stock, and

 (iii)      Action taken for the adjustment of deficiencies, excesses, etc., if any,

noticed during stock-taking.

    ANNEXURE  V

        [see Article  131  (n)]

                     PROCEDURE FOR UTILISING THE SERVICES OF THE

CENTRAL  PURCHASE  ORGANISATION

               When tenders are invited  from abroad, the following instructions should be

observed:—

1.   A  sufficient  supply  of  tender  forms  with  the  relevant  documents,

specifications and drawings should be sent as soon as possible to the

wing of the Central Purchase Organisation concerned which will give

such publicity to the invitation to tender as it considers to be the most

suitable for the purposes  either by advertisement  in the newspapers or

otherwise.    It  will,  as  a  rule,  advertise  the  invitation  to  tender  in  the
newspapers if the value of the articles required is estimated at ` 10,000
or more.  It will also instruct intending tenderers outside India to apply to

it for the tender forms and will supply copies on payment in sterling of

the charges  (if any)  to be fixed by it in each case.  It will at the same time

instruct the tenderers to submit their tenders direct to the  Purchasing

Officer in India and not to them. The Purchasing Officer in India will

place the order direct with the successful tenderer.

          2.     When it is desired to have the recommendation of the technical advisers

of the Central Purchase Organisation, i.e., the consulting Engineers, the

Naval Architects,  etc.,  on  the  tenders  before  the  order  is  placed,  the

Purchasing  Officer  should  stipulate  in  the  invitation  to  tender  that  a

195

complete duplicate of the tender should be delivered to them on the date

as that fixed for the receipt of the tenders in India. The Central Purchase
Organisation will then arrange for the examination of the tenders by the

195

                                      THE  KERALA  FINANCIAL CODE  VOL  I

ANNEXURE V ]

appropriated technical authority and will convey by the easiest means its

recommendation to the Purchasing Officer in India.

       3.  The Purchasing Officer should make it clear it every tender form that the
articles concerned must be delivered in India, that payment will be made in
Indian  Rupees,  and  that  any  tender  which,  does  not  comply  with  these
conditions will not be considered.  Tenderers abroad should also  be required
to specify their agents in India through whom delivery will be arranged and
payment received and who, when so required, will arrange for the erection of
the plant at the site and for the carrying out of such tests on completion as
may be specified in the contract.

196

          4.   It is important that Purchasing Officers should bear in mind, when considering
the desirability of calling for tenders abroad the need for allowing sufficient time
for the receipt and publication of invitation to tender, the receipt of the tender
forms by the tenderers, and the preparation and despatch of the tenders to India.

Time required for sending the forms from Kerala to London.

By ordinary Mail (2nd class mail matter only)

about 18 days

Time required by tenders for preparing and despatching tenders, say, 14 days.

Time required for forwarding tenders from London to Kerala.

The same at that entered above for sending the forms from Kerala to London.

              If continental or American tenders have to be awaited, about 3 or 4  weeks

respectively  should  be  added  to  the  above  figures,and  when  tenders  are

called for in connection with complicated Engineering  Schemes, a longer

time should be allowed for the preparation of tenders.

      6.        If any  tenderer withdraws from his tender before the expiry of the period

fixed for keeping the rates firm for acceptance, the earnest money, if any,

deposited by him will be forfeited to Government or such action taken

against him as Government thinks fit.

   7.     Tenderers shall invariably specify in their tenders the delivery conditions

including the time required for the supply of articles tendered for.

     8.        (a)      The tenderers shall clearly specify whether the articles offered bear Indian

Standards Institutions Certification Mark or not. In such cases, they shall

produce copies of certification mark along with their tender in support of it.

              (b)      Tenderers shall clearly specify whether the goods are offered from

indigenous sources, from imported stocks in India or from foreign

sources  to  be  imported  under  a  license.  Government  reserve  the

right to reject offers for import of goods if the Import Trade Control

restricts such imports.

     9.       The final acceptance of the tenders rests entirely with the Government who

prepared to guarantee satisfactory performance for a definite period under a

definite penalty.

      11.       Communication of acceptance of the tender normally constitutes a concluded
contract.  Nevertheless,  the  successful  tenderer  shall  also  execute  an
agreement  for  the  due  fulfillment  of  the  contract  within  the  period  to  be
specified in the letter of acceptance.  The contractor shall have to pay all
stamp duty, lawyer’s charges and other expenses incidental to the execution
of the agreement. Failure to execute the agreement within the period specified
will entail the penalties set out in para 12 below.

deposited by him will be forfeited to Government  and the contract

balance thereof, until such dispute is determined, the amount of such damages,

costs, charges and expenses as may be claimed. The same may also be deducted

202

      4.       In the case of goods delivered by shipment, the contractor shall where, the

expected tonnage of goods is more than 200 tonnes, deliver goods through

the Trivandrum Port, if so required by Government.

outside the district in which the claim arises shall be borne by the contractor.

      9.       The contractor shall not assign or make over in part or wholly the contract

  [ ARTS.  163-164

CHAPTER  VII

WORKS

   Introductory

163.     The term ‘works’ covers not only works of construction and repair of

buildings, roads, irrigation projects, etc., but also the manufacture, supply,

carriage  and  repair  of  tools  and  plant  and  other  stores  required  in

connection with works of construction and repair.

           The rules in this chapter are applicable to departments in general and are

236

supplemented for particular departments by the detailed rules and orders

contained in the respective departmental manuals and codes and any other

special orders applicable to them.

Classification of  Works

164.        Works  are  primarily  classified  into  “original  works”  and  “repairs  and

maintenance”.

               Original works include all new construction, whether of entirely new works
or of additions and alterations to existing works, reconstruction of entire

structures necessitated by wear and tear or by damage due to some calamity

and all repairs to newly purchased or previously abandoned buildings required

to  make them  usable.

               Repairs and maintenance include all the operations required from time to time to

maintain existing properties in a satisfactory state and make good the damage

due to wear and tear, when complete reconstruction is not necessary. Repairs are

further classified as “ordinary repairs” and “special repairs”. Ordinary repairs

include the periodical repairs which are done regularly as a matter of routine and
are usually of the same nature (e.g., painting or white-washing a building or

spreading a new coating of metal on a road), and any occasional petty repairs

from time to time, which may have to be carried out between the time fixed for

the periodical repairs. Ordinary repairs to an irrigation work include all the

236

  CHAPTER VII ]

WORKS

 [ ARTS.  164-165

operations required to maintain the work in a satisfactory state as it is, i.e., to
the standard already laid down. Special repairs are repairs, which are not
periodical or frequent e.g., re-roofing a building, replacing beams or renewing
a floor. Special repairs to an irrigation work  include all operations under
taken with a view to maintaining the work in a better condition, i.e., to a
higher standard than that already laid down, by using materials of a more
lasting kind, without increasing the efficiency or the scope of the system,
e.g., substituting cement plastering or pointing for ordinary plastering or
pointing,  substituting  plastering  for  pointing,  substituting  rough  stone
masonary for dry stone packing, revetting tank bunds at the sites of beaches
and  river  margins  where  they  are  eroded,  grouting  newly  the  surface  of
aprons and revetments and lengthening aprons and revetments to protect
the eroded portions of the beds and margins of rivers, canals and channels.

Certain  operations  are  partly  original  works  and  partly  repairs,  e.g.,
substitutions of a terraced roof for a tiled roof, substitution of steel beams
for damaged teak ones, or dismantling and extending a verandah.  A mixed
work  of  this  kind  should,  for  the  purpose  of  determining  the  authority
competent to sanction it, be treated as an original work. When a structure or
a part of a structure is dismantled because it is structurally unsound and
replaced by a new work which in  all material essentials merely reproduces
what was dismantled, the work is included in the category of repairs, unless
it is done to make newly purchased or previously abandoned building usable.

ALLOTMENT OF WORKS TO DEPARTMENTS

Works allotted to the Public Works Department

165.       The Public Works Department is responsible for the execution of all works
237
which the Government have not specifically allotted to other departments—
See Articles 166 to 171. In special circumstances a work for which the Public
Works Department is responsible may be executed by another department
on behalf of the Public Works Department by agreement between the two
departments.

237

  CHAPTER VII ]
                                      THE  KERALA  FINANCIAL CODE  VOL  I

  [ ARTS.  165-166

               Works executed by Government servants of other departments acting as Public

Works Disburses are usually petty works constructed on standard designs. Any

such Government servant may, however, apply to the Superintending Engineer

to depute a Public Works Officer to examine and such work when in progress or

when completed and to make a general report as to whether the work is being

satisfactorily carried out or has been completed in accordance with the estimate.

  Note:— The system to be adopted in the case of jail works should be as

follows:—

When jail works are executed by the contract system, jail labour should be

238

employed by the contractors on all unskilled items of works connected with

the contract as far as possible. Therefore when tenders are called for, for the

work  it should be stipulated in the tender notice that the contractor should

employ jail labour on all unskilled items of work connected with contract if

such labour  is available with the Jail Department and that the jail labour, if

supplied, will be charged for at the rate prescribed for the purpose. A similar

procedure should be adopted in regard to jail works executed departmentally

by the Public Works Department. In cases in which jail labour is not employed

on a work for the reason that the Jail Department is not able to supply it, a

written  statement  from  the  Jail  Superintendent  to  that  effect  should  be

obtained and recorded by the Public Works Department Officers.

Works allotted to the Forest Department

166.      The Forest Department’s works are usually executed in out-of-the-way localities
and under Special circumstances, with which Forest Officers are better acquainted
than Public Works Officers. The Government have therefore allotted to the Forest
Department all its own works except those for the execution of which the agency
of the Public Works Department is more suitable. If the Chief Conservator of
Forests wishes to entrust any such work to the Public Works Department, he
should address the Chief Engineer in the matter. When there is a difference
of opinion between the two officers in regard to any such proposal, the Chief
Conservator of Forests should obtain the orders of the Government.

238

  CHAPTER VII ]

WORKS

            [ ART.  167

Works allotted to the other Departments

167. (a) The Government have allotted the following works to the department which

uses or requires the building:—

          (i)      Works of petty construction, maintenance and repair, the estimated cost
of which does not exceed ` 2,500 for any one work relating to buildings
originally constructed by the Public Works Department, whether borne on

the Public Works Register or not.

         (ii)   Works of petty construction and repair of Police lines, huts and stations

which do not form part of Taluk Offices and other buildings orginally

constructed by the Public Works Department but not borne on the Public

Works Register, subject to the delegation of powers.

         (iii)   All works relating to buildings constructed by the departments other

than  Public Works  Department  and  not  borne  on  the  Public Works
Register.

    Note:— The repair and maintenance works will be undertaken by the Public

Works Department in respect of  a building which is occupied by more

than one department.

                  In the case of  a building occupied partly by a Local Fund Office along with

one or more Government Offices, the cost  of the annual repairs should not

exceed 1.5 percent or any other rate that may have been sanctioned on the

capital cost of the building.

                Each occupying department may carry out petty internal repairs in the portion
239

which it occupies.

            (b)  The  rules  and  conditions  governing  the  execution  of  such  works  by  the

department concerned are given below :

          (i)     All estimates should be covered by adequate budget provision.

239

CHAPTER VII ]

  [ ARTS.  167-168

        (ii)       Estimates of petty construction and repairs may be sanctioned by the

Heads of Departments. The Heads of Departments are authorised to

sanction estimates for annual thatching irrespective of the monetary

limit prescribed in (a) above.

         (iii)      Such works should ordinarily be undertaken by the departments using or

requiring them, utilising the funds placed at their disposal in the budget.

        (iv)    The works described above should not involve structural alterations and

additions to buildings in–charge of the Public Works Department. When

they involve structural alteration and additions to such buildings, civil

240

officers should obtain the concurrence of the Executive Engineer for the

same and should also communicate to the Executive Engineer, the actual

cost incurred so that the capital accounts of the buildings may be correctly

maintained.

         (v)       If repairs are sanctioned to the roof of a building occupied by more

than one department, they should be of a trifling nature.

       (vi)     Civil Officers should seek the assistance of the officers of the Public
Works Department wherever they consider that the work under taken

by them under these rules requires professional supervision.

168.       The allotment of certain works to departments other than the Public Works

Department in the preceding Article is subject to the following conditions:—

        (1)       If the work involves a structural alteration or addition to a building borne

on the Public Works Register, the Government servant who proposes to

sanction the work should obtain the Executive Engineer’s consent to the
proposed alteration or addition, and should also inform him of the actual
cost incurred, so that he may be able to maintain the capital accounts of the
building  correctly.  While  giving  his  concurrence  to  the  proposals  the
Executive Engineer should consider whether the work will require technical
advice of a skilled nature or professional supervision, and  if so, inform

240

CHAPTER VII ]

WORKS

  [ ARTS.  168-169

the Government servant concerned with the work that the necessary
technical  advice  or  assistance  will  be  given  by  the  Public  Works
Departmental Officer during the course of construction and that for
this  purpose  timely  intimation  should  be  given  of  the  date  of
commencement of the work.

        (2)         If the work relates to a building not borne on the Public Works Register
or relates to  a building borne on the Public Works Register but does
not involve any structural alteration or addition, the Government servant
who proposes to sanction the work should ask for advice or assistance
from a Public Works Officer only if he considers that the work requires
skilled technical advice or professional supervision. In that case, he
should inform the Public Works Officer for whose assistance he asked
of the reasons for his opinion. If the Public Works Officer considers
that the work does not require skilled technical advice or professional
supervision, he should return the requisition with a full statement of
the reasons for his opinion.

       (3)         A Government servant of another department who executes any work
relating to a building borne on the Public Works Register should inform
the Superintending Engineer annually not later than the first June, of
the amount spent by him on repairs to the building in the preceding
financial year.

169. (a) The allotment of certain works to departments other than the Public Works
Department in Article 167 does not apply to any works relating to the following
buildings, the maintenance and repairs of which, irrespective of cost, are
allotted to the Public Works Department:—

241

         (1)     Buildings whose capital cost is above  ` 50,000 and also buildings
whose  capital  cost  is  not  known,  but  whose  maintenance  cost
exceeds  ` 2,500 in each individual case or connected group.

the Forest Department.

(3)    Buildings which have been specially placed in-charge of the Public

Works Department for maintenance and repairs.

         (6)     Buildings occupied partly by the departments of the Central Government or
as official residences and partly by the departments of the Government of

items  such  as  white-washing  and  petty  repairs  to  walls,  inside  and
outside, repairs to floors including those of verandahs, repairs to ceiling,
repairs to doors and windows, painting or wood-oiling or varnishing
them inside as well as outside.

Note (ii)  :—  Petty  internal  repairs  may  be  attended  to  by  the  occupying
department. No alteration in any part which might have the effect of
altering any part of the design may be carried out with out reference to
the Public Works Department. (e.g., altering the pattern of the flooring
or using different quality of timber in connection with repairs to ceiling).

Note(iii) :— Repairs to roofing would be an item of external repair (to be
done by the Public Works Department ). So also repairs(internal as well
as external) to the out houses in common use and repairs to compound
walls. All special repair should like-wise be carried out by the Public
Works Department.

Superintending  Engineers  of  the  Public  Works  Department  will  forward

extracts from the Register of Lands and buildings of the particulars relating

to residential buildings under their control to the Accountant General direct.
Additions, corrections or modifications, if any, to these particulars should

also be forwarded to the Accountant-General once in every year, i.e., by the

first of May.

Electrical Works

171. (a)  As a rule, all original electrical works connected with Government buildings

243

will  be  executed  by  the  Electrical  Wing  attached  to  the  Public  Works

Department (Buildings and Roads Branch). If a Head of a Department wishes

to arrange for the execution of an electrical work himself, he should apply to
the  Government  for  the  allotment  of  the  work  to  his  Department.  If  the
Government  allot  the  work  to  his  department  he  should  get  the  detailed
plans and estimates prepared by the Electrical Wing of the P. W. D., call for
tenders and get the work executed by licensed Electrical Contractors. He

should request the Electrical Executive Engineer of the Electrical Wing in the
P. W. D . to give any technical advice or assistance needed in the execution
of work. He should also inform the Executive Engineer (Buildings and Roads)
of the expenditure he incurs on the work so as to enable him to maintain the
capital account of the buildings correctly.

        (b)   The custodian of the electrical installations of a Government building or part
there of will be the head of the office occupying the  building or part thereof.
Replacement  of  bulbs  and  starters  of  fluorescent  lights  and  bulbs  of
incandescent lights will have to be done by the custodians of the installations
for  which  required  bulbs,  tubes  and  starters  should  be  obtained  by  them
from the Electrical Radio Stores of  the P. W. D . and kept in their stock for
ready replacement. The replacement work will be attended to by the staff of
the Electrical Wing of the P. W. D.if required.

244

        (c)    Payment may be made in advance by the custodian of electrical installations
for  service  connections  to  Government  buildings,  if  the  supply  agency
requires this and the expenditure on this account  has to be met from the
contingencies of the concerned Department.

                                                            GENERAL RULES

      Selection of Site

172.      The site for a new building should, if possible, be fixed before the detailed
plans  and  estimates  are  prepared.  The  local  authority  concerned  should
always be consulted as to the suitability of the site, except when the proposed
new building is to be erected within a reserved forest.

         Preparation of Estimates

173. (a)  No work may be started before a proper estimate for it has been prepared and

sanctioned  by  the  competent  authority,  unless  it  is  so  started  strictly  in

accordance with a special order of the Government or some specific provision

in this Chapter or in departmental rule or order (See also Article 184 and 185).

244

  CHAPTER VII ]

WORKS

   [ ARTS.  173-174

         (b)   An estimate should be prepared in Form 23-A except when a special form of
estimate is required for a very large work or has been specially prescribed for

a particular kind of work in any departmental code, manual or order of the

Government.

        (c)   Every estimate, whether for an original work or for repairs, should provide

for the removal of all rubbish which may have accumulated, filling in unsightly

pits, etc., when necessary, at the site of the work; all work establishment

employed specially on the work; any incidental expenditure required, such

as  the  cost  of      sheds  for  workmen  and  stores;  and,  under  separate  sub-

heads  ;  all  watchman  sanctioned  by  competent  authority  for  the  care  of

vacant buildings, guarding works, working sluices, etc.

         (d)   An estimate for the annual maintenance of a building should provide for the

Municipal or other taxes payable on the property, and it should be submitted

to  the  Government  servant  occupying  the  building  concerned,  for

countersignature in token that it provides for all repairs known to be required.

When a specific period has been fixed after which a particular item or kind of

work should be renewed, every estimate for repairs should show the date it

was last renewed.

        (e)   Government servants of other departments who act as Public Works disbursers

in respect of any works (See Article 165) should prepare the estimates for them in

the forms adopted in the Public Works Department, together with the plans

where necessary, and obtain the necessary technical sanction of the competent

authority in the Public Works Department. Standard designs should be adopted,

as far as possible, with such modifications as circumstances may require.

245

Sanction for Works

174.(a)  The  powers  delegated  by  the  Government  to  the  various  departmental
authorities  to  sanction  expenditure  on  works  of  construction  and  repairs
allotted to the respective departments are specified in the Book of Financial
Powers.

245

                                      THE  KERALA  FINANCIAL CODE  VOL  I

CHAPTER VII ]

   [ ARTS. 174-176

         (b)  The power delegated to an authority subordinate to the Government to sanction

expenditure on works must not be so used as to evade the necessity for obtaining

sanction  from  a  higher  authority  by  sanctioning  in  instalments  a  group  of

connected works or alterations or a group of connected purchases the total cost

of which will exceed what that authority is empowered to sanction.

         (c)   The sanctioning or other prescribed departmental authority should communicate

every sanction to expenditure on works to the Accountant General in accordance

with the procedure laid down for each department, except when the sanction

relates to a work allotted to a department, other than the Public Works and Forest

246

and the bills relating to the sanction are to be drawn or countersigned by the

sanctioning authority itself.

         Estimates and Sanctions to be treated as confidential

175.         All Government servants should treat the rate and the amount of cost entered

against each item in an estimate and the abstract showing the total estimated

cost  of  a  work  or  part  of  a  work  as  strictly  confidential.  No  information

concerning them may be communicated on any account to any contractor,

piece-worker or prospective tenderer.

   Exception.— Contracts relating to extraction of timber in the Forest Department

are exempted from the operation of the above rule.

Utilisation of Savings

176.(a)     The sanction to an estimate should always be regarded as being strictly

limited to the precise objects for which the estimate was intended to provide.

Any anticipated or actual savings in a sanctioned estimate for a specified

work should not without the special sanction of a competent authority, be
applied to any additional work which was not originally contemplated,

unless it is fairly contingent on the actual execution of the work.

           (b)       Savings due to the abandonment of a substantial section of a work sanctioned

by any authority should not be applied to work on other sections without the

246

CHAPTER VII ]

WORKS

  [ ARTS.  176-178

special sanction of that authority. If the estimated cost of a section which is
abandoned is not less than 5 per cent of the total sanctioned cost of a work,

it should be treated as amounting to the abandonment of a substantial section

of the works. In the case of irrigation work the estimated cost of the Head

Works will be excluded in working out the sanctioned cost of the work for

this  purpose.

Supplementary Estimates

177.        In respect of a development of a work which is held to be necessary while it

is in progress but is not fairly contingent in the proper execution of the work

as  first  sanctioned,  a  supplementary  estimate  should  be  submitted  to  the

competent  authority  for  sanction  together  with  a  full  report  as  to  the

circumstances which make it necessary.

                 A Government servant who submits a supplementary estimate for sanction

should  see—

       (1)    That it is numbered consecutively with reference to the supplementary

estimates, if any, already submitted in respect of the same work; and

    (2)   That the application shows the amount of the original estimate, the

amount of the previous  supplementary estimates already sanctioned

or pending sanction, and the total amount of expenditure on the work

proposed  for  sanction,  including  the  amount  of  the  supplementary

estimate now submitted.

178. Works are executed by one of the undermentioned five methods—

Method of Executing Works
247

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

departmentally by the employment of daily labour,

by piece-work agreement,

by schedule contract,

247

                                      THE  KERALA  FINANCIAL CODE  VOL  I
CHAPTER VII ]

           [ ART.  178

(iv)

(v)

by lump sum contract, and

by percentage rate contract.

Method (i) is adopted in cases where no contractors are available or where

for  other  reasons,  it  is  found  more  economical.  Under  this  method,  the

department manufacturers or purchases its own materials. The purchase of

materials or tools and plant and machinery is governed by the Stores Rules.

                 Under method (ii)  the piece-worker merely agrees to execute a specified work at

specified rates without reference to quantity or time. The conditions of the

248

contract  and  the  security  to  be  taken  from  the  piece-worker  for  the  due

fulfilment of the contract are setforth in the standard forms. The piece-worker

usually  possesses  little  professional  knowledge  or  capital  or  employs  no

supervising staff.  The department arranges for the supervision,  the setting

out and measuring of all work. The piece-work system shall ordinarily be

confined to works (including improvements and repairs) costing not more
than  ` 2,500. If in any case of improvements and repairs costing above `
2,500 it is considered preferable to adopt the piece-work system instead of

method (iii) the reason, therefor should be recorded in the relevant file. The

schedule of rates in the piece-work agreements should show rates either for

finished work or for labour and materials, as the case may be, even for items

for which lump sum have been provided in the sanctioned estimates.

In regard to method (iii) under a schedule contract the contractor undertakes

to execute the work at specified rates, the sum he is to receive depending on

the quantities and kinds of work done or materials supplied. The work should

also be completed within a specified time-limit from the date of commencement

of work. These conditions are set forth in the standard form of agreement
(reproduced in Appendix I to Kerala Public Works Department Code).

                Under method (iv)   the contractor agrees to execute a complete work with all

its contingencies in accordance with the drawings and specifications for a

fixed sum. The essential characteristics of this kind of contracts are:

248

CHAPTER VII ]

WORKS

             [ ART.  178

    (i)         A  price adjustments schedule is specified in order to regulate the amount
to be added to or deducted from the fixed sum on account of additions and

alterations not covered by the contract.

     (ii)      Except as provided in clause (i) no addition is made in the contract

to  the  departmental  estimate  of  the  work,  schedule  of  rates  or

quantities of work to be done.

   (iii)   The detailed measurements of the work done are not required to be

recorded except in respect of additions and alterations.

Execution of works on lump sum basis will be resorted to only in exceptional

cases of absolute necessity. No such work should be executed without the

prior sanction of Government. The contract documents in such cases will be

got approved by Government in consultation with the Chief Engineer, the

Law Department and the Accountant General. Payments to contractors for

work done are made subject to the terms of the contract and any subsidiary

instructions issued by Government in this behalf and on the certificates of

the officers in charge of the work.

Under method (v) the departmental rates for the different items of work in an

estimate are published and the contractor quotes this rate at a percentage

above,  or  below  or  at  par  the  estimate  rates  so  published.  Only  a  single

percentage applicable to all the items is quoted and this percentage rate is

applicable to extra items also, if any, are found necessary during construction.

Other  conditions  of  contract  are  similar  to  those  applicable  to  schedule

contracts.

249

A modification of this type of contract is when, instead of estimate rates for

a work, the schedule of rates is published and the contractor is asked to
quote a percentage above, below or at par the schedule of rates so published.

Since neither the total quantity of work  nor the time is specified, this modified

form of percentage rate contract can be applied to piece work contracts only.

CHAPTER VII ]

   [ ARTS.  179-183

Purchase of Materials and Invitations to Tender

179.       When a Government servant buys materials for the execution of a work or

gives a work on contract, he should comply with the rules regarding the

purchase of stores and the general principles governing invitations to tender

contained in Chapter VI.

Provision of Funds

180.        Except  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of Articles  184  and  185  no

Government servant may enter into a contract for the execution of a work

250

unless  funds  have  been  duly  provided  for  it  or  an  assurance  has  been

received  from  the  authority  competent  to  provide  the  necessary  funds

that they will be allotted before the liability matures.

Execution of Agreements

181.        No work which is to be executed under a contract should be started until the
contractor has signed a formal written agreement, unless it is started without

a formal agreement under the provisions of Article 182 or Article 185.

182.        It is not essential to obtain a formal agreement in regard to any work of petty
construction  or  repairs  estimated  to  cost  not  more  than  `  1,000  but  a
Government servant competent to execute contracts may, when he considers

it desirable, obtain a formal agreement even in such a case. If no formal

agreement  is  executed;  there  should  at  least  be  a  written  understanding

specifying prices and rates, though it need not be in any prescribed form.

   Note:— The amount provided for rates and taxes and watchmen’s wages

whether a regular agreement with a contractor or piece-worker excluded

from the total amount for the purpose of deciding whether a regular
agreement with a contractor or piece-worker is necessary.

183.     When  a  Government  servant  of  a  department  other  than  the  Public Works

Department proposes to give a work on contract, he may consult the Executive

250

CHAPTER VII ]

WORKS

           [ ARTS.  183-184

Engineer, if he thinks it necessary, and should get an agreement executed in
the form used by the Public Works Department (with necessary changes) if

no  special  procedure  or  form  has  been  prescribed  for  the  purpose  in  the

departmental manual or code or by any order of the Government.

               The principles stated in Article 51 should be borne in mind when contracts

are drafted.

                            Starting of work without a sanctioned estimate or without

adequate funds having been provided

184.

If a higher authority orders a Government servant, on any ground whatever,

to  start  a  work  for  which  an  estimate  is  required  under  the  rules  but  no

estimate has been sanctioned or for which adequate funds have not been

provided  and  no  competent  authority  has  undertaken  to  provide  the

necessary funds, before the liability matures (whether an estimate has been

sanctioned or not), it should convey the order to start the work to him in

writing. A Government servant who starts any such work without a written

order from a higher authority and a Government servant who issues a written

order to start a work otherwise than in accordance with the rules will be liable

to be held personally responsible for paying for the work done if it is found

that his action was not fully justified by very exceptional circumstances. On

receipt  of  a  written  order  directing  him  to  carry  out  any  such  work,  a

Government servant should immediately inform the Accountant General that

he is starting a work for which no estimate has been sanctioned, or is incurring

a liability for which there is no provision or no sufficient provision of funds,

and should, at the same time, state approximately the amount of the liability

251

which he is likely to incur by complying with the written order which he has

received. The Accountant General will then be responsible for immediately

bringing the facts to the notice of the Head of the Department, except the

irregularities, if any, committed by the latter, which he should report at once

direct to the Government.  The Head of the Department should report to the

251

                                      THE  KERALA  FINANCIAL CODE  VOL  I
CHAPTER VII ]

                   [ ARTS. 184-185

Government any failure to comply with the rules  regarding works that call for

disciplinary action by the Government. The Accountant General will report

to the Government the facts of any case in which he considers the action

taken by the Head of the Department to be inadequate. The Government will

take disciplinary action against any Government servant – administrative or

executive who fails or delays to comply with these orders.

   Note :— The provisions of this Article will be relaxed in regard to famine

relief works but, this does not relieve any Government servant from his

responsibility for obtaining the necessary sanction to a revised estimate

252

and the necessary additional appropriation of funds, as soon as he can

foresee how far an estimate for a work entrusted to him for execution is

likely to be exceeded.

       Starting a work in an Emergency

185.     It  is  occasionally  necessary  for  a  Government  servant  to  start  a  work

immediately on the occurrence of some sudden, unforeseen emergency,

e.g., the breaching of the bund of an irrigation work, without waiting for

an estimate to be sanctioned and funds provided. A Government servant

who does this should report the facts at once his immediate superior and

to the Accountant General. If any such work is entrusted to a contractor

and it is impossible to enter into a formal agreement with him beforehand,

the  Government  servant  on  the  spot  who  arranges  for  the  work  to  be

started should at least enter into a piece-work agreement with him. This

can be terminated at anytime if the authority competent to sanction the

estimate should so decide when the emergency is such that even a piece-

work  agreement  cannot  be  completed  before  starting  the  work,  the

Government servant on the spot and the contractor should at least both
sign a written order for the work. If writing materials are not available at
the  time  and  the  work  has  to  be  started  with  out  a  written  order,  the
written order should be prepared and signed by the Government servant

252

 CHAPTER VII ]

WORKS

   [ ARTS.  185-187

and  the  contractor  as  soon  as  writing  materials  can  be  obtained.  The
Government servant should then prepare a proper estimate without any
avoidable  delay  and  submit  it  as  early  as  possible  to  the  competent
authority for sanction. A formal written agreement in the proper form (or
a written understanding specifying prices and rates if that is sufficient
with reference to Article 182) should then be concluded with the contractor
as expeditiously as possible.

Muster roll for a work executed departmentally

186.        Except for the permanent and temporary employees whose pay is charged to
the  head  “establishment”  and  the  members  of  the  work-charged
establishment, all persons who are engaged departmentally for the execution
of a work should be regarded as day labourers and their wages should be
drawn on muster rolls. The muster roll is the initial record of  labour employed
each day on a work. The Government servant in immediate charge of the
work should write it up daily.

187.          Muster  rolls  should  be  prepared  and  dealt  with  in  accordance  with  the

following rules:—

        (a)        One or more muster rolls should be kept for each work but a muster
roll should never be prepared in duplicate. One muster roll may be kept
for labourers employed on several small works, if there is no objection
to regarding the total unpaid wages as relating only to the largest work
in the group.

    (b)    Every entry in a muster roll should be made, if possible, in ink and

otherwise in indelible pencil.
253

       (c)       Labourers may be paid once a month and separate muster rolls should

be prepared for each month.

      (d)      The daily attendance or absence  of each labourers and any fine inflicted on

him should be accorded daily in Part I of the muster roll in such a way as—

253

   (i)         to facilitate the correct calculation of his net wages for the period of

payment;

   (ii)        to render it difficult to tamper with or to make unauthorised additions

to, or alterations     in entries once made; and

   (iii)          to facilitate the correct classification of the cost of labour by works

and sub-heads of     works, where necessary.

    Note:—  Superior  Officers  should  check  the  attendance  of  labourers  as

frequently as possible.

254

      (e)        After a muster roll has been passed by the Government servant who is

authorised to draw the bill for the works expenditure, payment should

be  made  as  soon  as  possible.  Each  payment  should  be  made  or

witnessed by the Government servant of highest standing available.

He should certify to the payments  individually or by groups and also

record at the foot of the muster roll, both in words and figures, the total

amount paid on each date.  The details of unpaid items, if any, should

be  recorded  in  the  Register  of  Unpaid  Wages  and  the  amount  so
transferred deducted from the grant total of the muster roll so as to

bring out the “balance paid” before the Government servant who makes

the payments, completes the memorandum at the foot of the muster

roll.

       (f)          Payments of unpaid items carried forward to the Register of Unpaid

Wages, when made, should be recorded and certified in the same

way as payments of current items.

     (g)         All wages not claimed within three months should,  as a rule, be forfeited.

Note 1:— In the Forest Department wages remaining unpaid for three months

should be reported to the Divisional Forest Officer who will decide in

each  case  whether  the  liability  should  continue  to  be  borne  in  the

accounts of the work concerned.

see the Local Ruling under Article 121 in the Kerala Account  Code,

Volume III.

     (h)        The progress of the work done by the labourers should be recorded in

Part II of the muster roll, if the work can be measured. If it cannot be

measured, a remark should be recorded to that effect. Part II need not

be written up at all when progress is reported once a month or often or

in  any  other  suitable  form  and  the  separate  reports  are  considered

sufficient.

       (i)        The Government servant who is responsible for the payments need not

submit  the  paid  muster  rolls  to  any  higher  authority,  unless  he  is

specially instructed to do so.

      Labour engaged departmentally through a contractor

188.       When work is executed departmentally by the employment of daily labour

(See Article  178),  it  is  objectionable  in  principle  to  engage  and  pay  the

necessary  daily  labour  through  a  contractor  instead  of  on  a  muster  roll
under the ordinary procedure. In a great emergency it may sometimes be

impossible to obtain the necessary labour in time otherwise than through a

contractor. If it is possible, in such a case , to determine the quantity of work

done after its completion or at intervals during its progress, the contractor

should be paid at suitable rates for the work actually done. If this is not

practicable, the contractor may be paid according to the number of labourers

employed  each  day,  and  his  own  profit  or  commission  should  either  be

included  in  the  rates  allowed  or  paid  separately  in  a    lump  sum  or  at  a

255

percentage  rate. With  a  view  to  avoiding  disputes  with  the  contractor  in
such a case, he should be requested to sign the daily reports in token that he

accepts them as correct. The muster roll and the measurement book should

not be used when the contractor is paid according to the number of labourers

employed each day.

189. (a)   All works done otherwise than by daily labour and all supplies relating to a

Measurement Book

work  should  be  paid  for  on  the  basis  of  measurements  recorded  in  a

Measurement Book, Form K. P. W. 21. The measurement book is the original

record of actual measurement or count. The descriptions in a measurement

book should be lucid, so that the items described may be easily identified

and checked.  A measurement book is a very important record and must be

kept with great care, since it may have to be produced as evidence in a court

of law.

256

    Note:— In  the Forest Department the measurement book is to be maintained

for works under the budget head “Communications and Buildings” in
all cases where the amount expended exceeds  ` 50. The sanctioning
authority will, however, be permitted to order the maintenance of a

measurement book in other case while communicating its sanction to

the executive subordinate concerned.

    (b)     Whenever a measurement book changes hands, even if it is sent only from one

office to another within the same building, some responsible person of a

grade not below that of a clerk should acknowledge receipt of it in writing.

190.        Government servants should strictly observe the following general instructions

in regard to measurement book:—

        (1)   All measurements should be taken down neatly in a measurement book

issued  for  the  purpose  and  nowhere  else.  No  one  may  record  any

measurements in a measurement book except a Government servant

who is duly empowered to make payment for the work done or a duly

authorised executive subordinate in immediate charge of the work who
has been supplied with a measurement book.

        (2)   The lines under columns (1) to (4)  on each page beginning with the top

line, should invariably be filled up at the work. No line should be left

256

 CHAPTER VII ]

    [ ART.  190

blank. Any lines that are not required on any page should be carefully
scored through, so that no additional entry can be made afterwards.

      (3)    Each set of measurements should begin with entries showing:—

                   (i)    In the case of work done-

                           (a)     full name of work as given in the estimate,

           (b)     situation of work,

            (e)     date of commencement of work (i.e., date on which site was

      handed over ),

           (f)      date of actual completion of work, and

            (g)     date of measurement; or,

                  (ii)    In the case of materials supplied—

                           (a)     name of supplier,

           (b)     number and date of his agreement, if any, or of the order,

           (c)     purpose of supply,

            (d)     date of written order to begin supplies,

           (e)     date of actual completion of supplies, and

            (f)      date of measurement.

                  Each set of measurements should end with the dated signature and designation

of the Government servant who takes the measurements. A suitable abstract

should then be prepared which should show, in the case of measurements for

work  done  the  total  quantity  of  each  distinct  item  of  work  relating  to  each

257

sanctioned  sub-head.

  (4)     Since all payments for work or supplies are based on the quantities
recorded in the measurement book, a Government servant who takes
the measurements must take all possible care to record the quantities
clearly  and  accurately.  He  will  also  be  held  responsible  for  the

correctness of the entries in the column “contents or area” in respect

of the measurements recorded by him. If the measurements are taken in

connection with a running contract account on which work has been

previously measured, he will also be held responsible for recording a

reference to the last set of measurements. If the measurements taken

are the first set of measurements on a running account, or the first and

final measurements this fact should be suitably noted against the entries

in  the  measurement  book,  and  in  the  latter  case  the  actual  date  of

completion should be noted in the prescribed place. The signature of

258

the  contractor  or  his  agent  should  be  obtained  in  the  measurement

book after each set of measurements below the statement. “I accept the

measurements”. If the contractor or his agent is illiterate, his mark should

be attested by an independent witness.

       (5)    Entries should be recorded continuously in the measurement book. No

page should be left blank or torn out. If a page is left blank inadvertently,

it should be cancelled by diagonal lines as soon as this is noticed, and

the  cancellation  should  be  attested  by  the  dated  initials  of  the
Government servant concerned.

      (6)    No erasures is permitted. If a mistake is made the Government servant

who is responsible should correct it and attest the correction by his

dated initials. When any measurements are cancelled, the cancellation

must be attested by the dated initials of the Government servant who

orders  it  or  supported  by  reference  to  his  orders  initialled  by  the

Government servant who took the measurements. In either case, the

reason for the cancellation should always be recorded.

    (7)   Entries should be made, if possible, in ink and otherwise in indelible

pencil. Pencil entries should never be linked over. Every entry in the

“contents or area” column should be made in ink.

      (8)     Each measurement book should contain an index and the Government

servant in charge of it should keep the index upto date.

      (9)     At the time of payment, the Government servant who authorises payment

should  draw  a  diagonal  red  ink  line  across  every  page  containing  the

detailed measurements relating to the work or supplies paid for, and should

record reference to the number and date of the voucher or sub-voucher

in the abstract of measurements.

   (10)     The measurement book should be produced for inspection on request

by the Accountant General or a duly authorised member of his staff.

Check- Measurement of Works

191.(a)  When a departmental rule or order requires that a work be check-measured

before payment, the contractor should not be paid for work done until it has

been check-measured by the prescribed authority. Superior officers should

also make a point of checking the detailed measurements of works in the

course of their tours.

        (b)    Check-measurement is intended to detect errors and prevent fraudulent entries.

It should therefore be done with discretion and method. The items which appear

most likely to be incorrect and most easily susceptible of fraud and those which

would seriously affect the total of the bill if inaccurate should be selected for

check-measurement.

        (c)     When measurements are taken jointly by more than one Government servant,

the senior most of them should record and sign the measurements.
259
Aid to Contractors

192. (a) No advance should be paid to a contractor except with the special sanction

of the Government or of a competent authority to whom they have delegated

power to sanction such advances. Government servants should make every

endeavour to maintain a system under which payment is made only for work

     [ ARTS.  192-193

actually done. When, in exceptional circumstances, a Government servant

considers essential to give a contractor an advance, he should apply to the

competent authority for sanction. Whenever any such advance is sanctioned,

all the Government servants concerned should take the necessary precautions

to  secure  the  Government  against  loss  and  to  prevent  the  system  from

becoming general or continuing longer than is necessary.

       (b)     Government funds may be spent on behalf of a contractor in accordance with the

terms of his agreement and subsequently recovered from him, when it is necessary

to engage labourers or contractors or incur other liabilities on his behalf in order

260

to complete work which he has neglected or failed to complete with reference to

the terms of his agreement. Government materials are also supplied to a contractor

in certain circumstances, subject to full recovery of the cost from him. Special

care should be taken in connection with all recoverable charges to see that the

contractor or other person on whose behalf the charges have been incurred is

not allowed the benefit or any concession to which he would not be entitled if he

had himself incurred the charges.

Liability of Contractors

193.        When  a  contractor  has  entered  into  an  agreement  to  execute  a  work  but

subsequently, for any cause whatever, anticipates that the contract will result

in a net loss to him this should not be accepted as a reason for not compelling

him to complete the work. A contractor should look after his own interest

properly when entering into an agreement, and has no claim to any leniency

in enforcing a contract, when it turns out to be less favorable to him than he

originally anticipated.

Completion Report

194.       When a work has been duly completed, the Government servant who pays for

it should have a completion report prepared and forward it to the Accountant

General or other prescribed authority in accordance with the rules applicable

260

 CHAPTER VII ]

WORKS

               [ ARTS.  194-196

to  his  department.  The  report  should  be  prepared  in  the  form  specially
prescribed for the department concerned or in Form 24. Every completion

report should show the name of the work, the number and date of the order

sanctioning  it,  the  amount  of  expenditure  sanctioned  and  the  actual

expenditure incurred. If the actual expenditure exceeds the amount in the

sanctioned estimates, the completion report  should be sent to the prescribed

authority through the authority which sanctioned the estimate. The reasons

for the excess expenditure should be stated in the completion report, and the

sanction of the authority competent to sanction the total expenditure should

be obtained and recorded.

  Note :— The above rule does not apply to the Public Works Department,

Government  servants  of  this  department  should  follow  the  rules

contained in the departmental code or manual as regards reporting the

completion of works.

Disposal of Surplus Materials

195.        As soon as a work has been completed, or as soon as it becomes clear that

no materials will be required for use in executing it, the Government servant

in  charge  of  the  work  should  arrange  to  dispose  of  all  surplus  materials

belonging to the Government either by transfer to other works in progress or

by sale.

Protection of Religious Edifices

196.       No temple, mosque, church, chapel, tomb or other building devoted to religious
261

use  should  on  any  account  be  destroyed,  injured  or  occupied  in  connection

with the execution  of any work unless it is done under a special order of the

Government or with the full and free consent of the persons interested in the
religious edifice and the concurrence of the principal  civil authority on the spot.

     Authorities competent to sanction miscellaneous expenditure

Except  when  the  expenditure  is  authorised  by  this  Code  or  some  other
authorised  Code  or  Manual  or  by  some  general      or  special  order  of  the
Government, no Government servant should incur any item of miscellaneous
expenditure (defined in Article 3) of any kind without the specific sanction of
Government  or  a  competent  authority  to  whom  the  Government  have
delegated the power to sanction such expenditure (See Article 43).

200.

201.

The procedure to be observed for the payment of compensation for lands
taken up for public purposes under the Kerala Land Acquisition Act, 1961
(21 of 1962) is contained in the Kerala Land Acquisition Manual.

In case of acquisition of lands for public purposes departmental officers
should  see  that  compensation  is  settled  before  possession  is  taken,  and
Land Acquisition Officers should see that payment of compensation is not
delayed  and  possession  is  handed  over  in  due  course  to  the  departments
concerned  in  a  formal  manner.  In  cases  where  in  contravention  of  this
direction,  possession  is  taken  and  owing  to  any  inordinate  delay  in  the
payment or tender of such compensation, it becomes necessary to pay interest
under  the  provisions  of  the  Land Acquisition Act,  the  officer  or  officers
responsible  will  render  themselves  personally  liable  to  make  good  such
amount.

263
202.       The procedure for the payment of compensation for lands acquired by private
negotiations should follow the lines of those laid down for acquisition under
the  Land Acquisition Act. The  officer  who  settles  the  price,  etc.,  should
draw up the prescribed form as in the case of an award and this should be the
basis of subsequent payment and audit.

205. (a)  Family and Political Pension.— These are all paddy pensions converted

into cash payments with effect from 1st February 1955 at commutation rates

to be fixed by the Government from year to year and payable only after the

15th of May of each year. Payments may be made at any of the treasuries of

the State and the payees are at liberty to choose the treasury from which

they shall receive payment. (See also Appendix 16 of K.T.C. Vol. II.)

       (b)  Malikhanas.— These are allowances paid in lieu of the rights enjoyed by

some former Rajas and Chieftains. These allowances are treated as Political

Pensions,  governed  by  the  Pensions Act  (Central Act),  1871.  When  the

holder of a Malikhana dies it should be continued to be paid to the senior

member of the family concerned.  The devolution of seniority will depend on

the personal law or custom applicable to each case. The District Collectors

of the respective districts shall be competent to order the re-registration of

the Malikhana in the name of the senior member, on the death of the previous

holder. However, the Government reserve the rights to:

    (1)      decide doubtful cases,

    (2)      sanction the payment of Malikhana,

    (3)      sanction the life time arrears of Malikhana, and

   (4)     decide the successor to receive the arrear of Malikhana due to a

deceased Malikhana, Pensioner.

             Transfer of payment of Malikhana Allowance from one treasury to another

consequent on the change of residence are allowed by the Government or
the Accountant General on the following conditions:—

       (i)   The transfer of payment of Malikhana from one treasury to another in
the same district may be effected just like the transfer of other kinds of
pension.

individual P.P.Os.  may be issued in favour of the Malikhanadar.

       (iii) The Government or Accountant General may permit the transfer of

payments of Malikhana pension from one Treasury to another provided

the Accountant General should obtain the concurrence of the authority,

viz., the Government empowered to permit the changes of residence by

the Political Pensioner. But the transfer of the payment of the Malikhana

allowance from one treasury to another should not be frequently made

at  the  convenience  of  each  pensioner.  Permanent  change  in  the

266

headquarters of the “Sthanam” should be the criterion for allowing a

transfer of payment from one Treasury to another and not a shift in the

residence of particular pensioner holding the “Sthanam”.

         (iv)   In cases where such transfer is allowed a separate Group Register should

be opened for the payment in the new Treasury.

    Note:— Life time arrears of pension due to deceased Political, Revenue and

Malikhana Pensioners shall be paid to the claimant only on production

of succession certificate from the authority who sanctioned the pension

to the effect that the arrears may be paid to him. The authority who

issues the succession certificate shall do so only after enquiring into in

detail the right of the claimant for succession to the family right or

sthanam and other relevant aspects. If there are more than one claimant

the names of the persons and the share of the amount  each is entitled

to receive shall be specified in the certificate. After paying the arrears

of pension on account of a deceased pensioner the disbursing officer

shall  return  both  the  halves  of  the  pension  payment  order  to  the

Accountant General (through the District treasury officer if payment of

pension  is  made  at  a  Sub-Treasury)  with  a  note  of  the  date  of  the

applicable to these allowances as well. These allowances shall be paid in

money at the commutation rates of paddy fixed by Government every year

and  shall  become  payable  only  after  the  15th  of  May  of  each  year. The

commutation  rate  for  a  year  should  be  calculated  based  on  the  average

market rate of paddy for the particular year.  Payments in cash may be made

at any of the treasuries of the State and the payees are at liberty to choose

the treasury from which they shall receive payment (See also Appendix 16 of

K.T.C. Vol. II).

religious institutions and also to persons for various reasons, such as for services

to be rendered in lieu of resumption of lands by Government, etc. In some cases

these are paid in the nature of assignment of land revenue. The Village Officers

of the respective villages are authorised to pay these allowances to the concerned

persons or institutions from the Village collections on obtaining simple receipts.

The allowances due for a financial year should be paid in the month of March of

that year. In respect of arrears, the Village Officers are not competent to make

payments from the Village collections. Arrears should be paid in cash from the

The Board of Revenue is competent to revive an allowance which has once been

struck off, if there are sufficient grounds.

A register in the Form 24A should be maintained in the Village and the Taluk

268

Offices to account for the payments of these allowances. The  Village Officer

should note the payments made from the Village  collections, in the remittance

lists, on the dates of remittance and  produce the receipts for the payment in

the Taluk Office. In the Taluk Office necessary action should be taken for

transfer crediting the amounts paid from the Village collections. After the

adjustments are made, the fact should be noted in the Taluk Register.

Departmental Payments

206.       Departmental payments such as those for the purchase of salt, opium and

ganja by the Excise Department, water-marked paper by the Stamp Department,

Stationery by the Printing and Stationery Department, etc., are made under

general or special sanction. If not provided for by departmental rules, they

should be made upon separate bills accompanied by vouchers and a certificate

that the articles billed for have been received in good order and accounted

for in the ‘Stock Register’, the quantities are correct, the quality is good, the

rates paid are not in excess of the accepted and market rates, and that suitable

notes of payment have been recorded against the original indents and the
invoices concerned, to prevent double payment. The authority, unless it is a

general one under which the purchase is made should also be quoted in the

to make grants from Public Funds to denominational institutions. The State

may make such grants-in-aid for public purposes or activities carried on by

private institutions or local bodies as are in conformity with Article 282 of

sanctions for grants-in-aid:—

      (1)         Unless in any case Government directs otherwise, every order sanctioning

a grant should specify clearly the object for which it is given and the

conditions,  if  any,  attached  to  the  grant.  In  the  case  of  non-recurring

grants for specified objects, the order should also specify the time-limit

within which the grant or each instalment of it is to be spent.

      (2)      Only so much of the grant should be paid during any financial year as

is  likely  to  be  expended  during  that  year.  In  the  case  of  grants  for

specific works or services such as building, water supply schemes and

the  like,  the  sanctioning  authority  should  use  its  discretion    in

authorising  payments  according  the  needs  of  work.  The  authority

signing or countersigning a bill for grant-in-aid should see that money

is not drawn in advance of requirements. There should be no occasion

for a rush for payment of these grants in the month of March.

authority  should  as  far  as  possible  insist  of  obtaining  an  audited

statement of the account of the body or institution concerned in order

to see that the grant-in-aid is justified by the financial position of the

grantee and to ensure that previous grant, if any, was spent for the

purposes for which it was intended.

         The authority sanctioning a grant, while communicating the sanction

to the Accountant General should state whether the audited statement

of accounts has been  received when required, or whether the grantee

has been exempted from submitting the statement.

        Note 1:— For purposes of audited  statements of accounts of any public

body  or  institution,  it  is  not  essential  that  the  accounts  should  be

audited  in  every  cases  by  the  Indian Audit  Department.  It  will  be

sufficient  if  the  accounts  are  certified  as  correct  by  a  registered

272

accountant or other registered body of auditors. In the case of small

institutions, which cannot afford to obtain the services  of a registered

accountant  or  other  registered  body  of  auditors,  the  sanctioning

authority may exercise its discretion of exempting any such institution

from the submission of accounts audited in this fashion.

        Note 2:— This provision applies both to non-official institutions and to

semi official ones, such as Public Clubs, etc. In all sanctions of grant of

a  capital    nature  and  for  specific  purposes  made  to  institutions  and

public  bodies,  the  sanctioning  order  should  contain  a  clause  to  the

effect  that,  if  so  required  by  the Accountant  General,  the  accounts

together with all the relevant papers of the institutions shall have to be

produced for inspection by the Indian Audit Department.

    (4)      No Grants-in-aid shall be sanctioned in cases where there is a reasonable

suspicion or suggestion of corrupt practices unless the grantee institutions

concerned are cleared of the allegations.  Before sanctioning the grants-in-

aid, the sanctioning authority should satisfy that the grantee institutions

are free from corrupt practices and certify in each case that this aspect has

been considered before sanctioning the grant and that there is no reason

to believe that the grantee institutions are involved in corrupt practices.

any recommendations for the grant by the Government for compensation to
a Government servant for loss of his property:—

    (1) (a)    Claims to compensation for loss of property made by Government

servants will ordinarily be considered only in cases in which—

         (i)    The exposure of the property to risk is directly connected with the
duties on which theGovernment servant is employed at the time,
e.g., when the action on an enemy force,   insurgents, raiders or wild
tribes causes a loss of property of a Government servant  employed

in the area affected;

                                                 or

288

CHAPTER VIII ]

MISCELLANEOUS   EXPENDITURE

            [ ART.  231

       (ii)    the property is lost in consequence of endeavours on the part of a
Government servant to save the property of the Government which

was also endangered at the time;

                                 or

       (iii)     the property is destroyed under the orders of a competent authority.

         (b)        No compensation will be paid in respect of any loss which is due in any

way  of  negligence  or  other  default  on  the  part  of  the  claimant.

Compensation will also not be granted when, as a matter of ordinary

prudence, the Government servant who owned the property could and

should have insured it. The question whether the property should have

been insured is a question of fact to be decided by the Government.

       (c)        Compensation will not ordinarily be granted to a Government servant for

any loss of his property which is caused by natural calamities e.g., an

earthquake or flood, or which is due to an ordinary every day accident

such as may occur to any citizen, e.g., loss by theft even when accompanied

by violence, or loss due to a railway accident, fire, etc. The mere fact that

at the time of the accident, the Government servant is technically on duty

or is living in Government quarters in which he is bound to reside for the

performance of his duties will not be considered as a sufficient ground for

the grant of compensation.

289

         (d)      The grant of compensation may be recommended in respect of animals
(i)  that are killed, captured or stolen by an enemy force, (ii) that are
destroyed  under  the  orders  of  a  competent  authority  to  prevent  the
spread of infectious or contagious diseases, or (iii) that die as a result
of exposure or excessive work necessitated by use in the public service,
or of an accident directly due to such use. When an animal belonging
to a Government servant is destroyed under the orders of a competent
authority to prevent the spread of an infectious or contagious desease,
the  amount  of  compensation  recommended  should  not  exceed  the
amount payable to a private person in similar circumstances.

      (2)   When any  one of the three conditions mentioned in instruction  (1) (a) is

satisfied,  the  Head  of  the  Department  may  recommend    the  grant  of

compensation to the Government servant concerned as an act of grace upto

the value at the time of loss of the necessaries lost by him. The Head of the

Department  should  examine  the  question  whether  the  articles  lost  are

“necessaries” within the meaning of this instruction with reference to the

Government servant’s personal standing and circumstances and make his

recommendation accordingly.

                                  *Expenditure for the transportation of dead body of a

290

Government servant dying in harness

expenditure  on  this  account  will  be  debited  to  the  detailed  head  “other

charges” of the department/office concerned.

LOANS  AND  ADVANCES

General–Main Classes of  Loans and Advances

232.     Loans and advances made by Government fall under the following main

classes of loans :

        (a)   Loans to Port Trusts and other Port Funds.

        (b)   Loans to Municipal Corporations and Municipalities.

          [ ARTS. 2333-234

Note:— Heads of Departments and other Government Servants may sanction
loans  of  classes    (e)  to  (j)  *[other  than  Government  Companies/
Corporations] to the extent of the powers delegated to them and the
appropriations placed at their disposal (See Book of Financial Powers).
The  Government  have  not  delegated  to  any  authority  any  power  to
sanction loans of the other classes falling under this head and they are,
therefore, sanctioned only by the Government.

            All the departmental officers operating the heads of account under !F.
Loans and Advances should specify invariably in the sanction, the major,
minor, †sub and detailed head of account to which the loans sanctioned
by them are to be debited.

General Instructions

234.

The following general instructions apply to all loans falling under this head
and  the  conditions  on  which  the  loans  are  granted  should  be  framed  in
accordance  with them :—

        (1)    Before considering a loan application, the following requirements should

be fulfilled:–

     (i)  There should be adequate budget provision.

      (ii)  The  grant  of  the  loan  should  be  in  accordance  with  the  approved
Government policy and accepted pattern of assistance. It is important

that,  in  view  of  the  shortage  of  financial  resources,    the  scope  of

financial assistance in the shape of loan should not be expanded to include

new types of loans or objects for which loans are not granted ; nor should

the accepted pattern of assistance be varied.

    (iii)  The  applicant  should  be  asked  to  furnish  the  following  materials  and

information:—

* Substitution C.S.No.12/76 [G.O.(P) No. 357/76/Fin., Dated 22/11/1976]

             [ ART. 234

   (a)    Copies of profit and loss (or income and expenditure) accounts and

balance sheet  for the last 3 years.

   (b)     The main sources of income and how he proposes to repay the loan

within the  stipulated period.

    (c)      The security proposed to be offered for the loan together with a valuation

of the  security  offered by an independent authority and a certificate that

the assets offered  as security are not already encumbered.

   (d)    Details of loan or loans taken from the Central Government or State

Government in  the past indicating the amount, purpose, Ministry or

State from which loan was  taken, rate of interest, stipulated period of

repayment, date of original loan and  amount outstanding against the

loan(s) on the date of the application and the assets,  if any, given as

security.

    (e)       A  complete list of all other loans outstanding on the date of application

and the assets given as security against them.

   (f)    The purpose for which the loan is proposed to be utilised and the

economics of the scheme.

      Note:— Where the loan is to be given to an institution on the strength of a

guarantee given by the Trust managing it, similar information should be

called for in respect of the Trust also. On receipt of the above information,

confidential enquires should be made from the other concerned Governments

from which the party has taken loans to judge his performance in regard to

these previous loans. If the replies indicate that the performance was not

295

satisfactory, the loan should be refused. In other cases it should be satisfied
from the information supplied that the financial position of the party is sound

and  he  can  be  reasonably  expected  to  repay  the  loans  in  the  prescribed

period, either from the income from the specific scheme for which the loan is

sought or from his general income. It must be noted that it is not always

295

   CHAPTER IX ]

                                      THE  KERALA  FINANCIAL CODE  VOL  I

           [ ART.  234

sufficient to have what may be considered as adequate security if the financial

position of the party is not sound. In the event of default it may be difficult

for Government to enforce the sale of the asset offered as security, especially,

if it is not an earning asset. It is, therefore, important to see that both the

criteria are satisfied.

                 It might become necessary to obtain information periodically regarding the

financial position of the applicant after the grant of a loan. For this purpose,

a clause should be inserted in all loan agreements enabling Government at

any time to call for the accounts of the applicant relating to any accounting

296

year with power to depute an officer, specially authorised for this purpose, to

inspect the applicant’s books, if necessary.

               Loans should not be given at concessional rates of interest. If any concession is

considered necessary, it should be given as a straight-forward grant unless a

policy regarding the grant of such a concession has already been laid down by

Government.

    (2)       Interest:— Interest should be charged at the rate prescribed by the Government

for the class of loans concerned. It should be charged for the day of advance, but

not for the day of repayment. For a period of less than a complete half year, the

interest should be calculated as

the number of days

              365                      x      the  yearly rate of interest.

For a period of more than a half year but less than a year, half the yearly

interest  should  be  charged  inrespect  of  the  completed  half  year  together

with interest for the remaining period of less than a half year calculated as
above. In the case of “Advances to cultivators”, however the interest for a

period of less than a year should be calculated by taking the calendar month

as the unit, periods of fifteen days or more in a calendar month being treated

as one calendar month  and periods of  less than fifteen days being ignored.

296

CHAPTER IX ]

LOANS   AND  ADVANCES

             [ ART.  234

     (3)      Repayment:— (a) The borrower should be required to repay the loan in full
within a specific term, which should be as short as possible, by paying the

appropriate  fixed  instalments  not  later  than  the  dates  prescribed    by  the

Government or other competent authority.  The term should run from the

date on which the drawal of the loan is completed, unless the Government or

other competent authority declare the loan closed with effect from an earlier

date,  in  which  case  it  should  run  from  that  date.  The  amount  of  each

instalment to be repaid by the borrower should be rounded to the nearest

rupee except in the case of the last instalment where the amount will be

rounded to the nearest multiple of 5 paise.

        (b)   If a borrower draws a loan in instalments and is required to repay it by

half-yearly instalments for which  no specified half-yearly  dates are

fixed when the loan is sanctioned, he should be required to make the

first regular half-yearly payment six months after the date from which

the term of the loan runs, and simple interest only should be charged

on that date for the period prior to it.

         If specified half-yearly dates are fixed for the payment of the half-yearly

instalments when the loan is sanctioned, the borrower should be required

to make the first regular half-yearly payment on the second of those half-

yearly dates after the date from which the term of the loan runs, and simple

interest only should be charged on the first half-yearly date. For example,

if the drawal of a  loan is completed on the 31st March and the instalments

are payable half-yearly on the 30th June and 31st December, the first

regular  half-yearly  instalment  should  fall  due  on  the  31st  December

297

following, and simple interest only should be charged on the 30th June.

          If a borrower unduly delays the completion of the drawal of a loan, the
matter  should  be  reported  to  the  Government  or  other  competent
authority with a recommendation that the loan be declared to have
been closed as from a suitable specified date. The Accountant General

watches the recoveries relating to each individual loan included in  any
of the following classes of loans mentioned in  Article 232.

        Items (a),  (b),  (c),  (d),  (i)  and the portion of  (j) relating to loans to

individuals and to local bodies to cover revenue deficits.

         He should report to the Government any undue delay in completing the

drawal of any such loan payable in  instalments, whether dates have been

fixed for the drawal of instalments, or not. The departmental authorities

concerned  should  take    necessary  action  in    regard  to  undue  delay  in

298

completing the drawal of any other loan payable in instalments.

          This  instruction  applies  mutatis  mutandis  to  loans  repayable  by

instalments other than half-yearly instalments.

 #(c)     Any instalment paid before its due date may be taken entirely towards

principal, provided it is accompanied by payment towards interest due

upto the date of actual payment of instalment, if not the amount of the

instalment will first be adjusted towards the interest due for the preceding

and current periods and the balance, if any, will alone be applied towards
the principal. If, however, the payment of the instalments is in advance of

the due date by 14 days or less, interest for the full period (half year or full

year as the case may be) will be payable.

    (d)        The instalments towards the repayment of loans and advances granted

by the Government which fall due on public holidays should, in cases

not otherwise specifically provided for, be paid into the treasury on the

working day immediately preceding the holiday. This will not affect

payments which are made by book adjustments.

    (e)      All officers who are responsible for the maintenance of loan registers

and for watching the recovery of the loans will issue warning notices

month prior to the due date) indicating the number of the instalment
amount due (principal and interest may be shown separately) the correct
head of account under which principal and interest should be paid,
arrears, if any, under principal and interest etc. with a request to pay
the dues before the due date. Omission to give the above warning will
not give the loanees any claim to exemption from the consequences of
default in the repayment of principal or interest thereon.

        (4)     Defaults in  payment.— (a) The Accountant General should report promptly
to the Government any failure by a borrower to pay on the due date a payment
due under a loan included in  one of the classes of loans which he watches
individually  –  See  sub-clause  (b)  of  clause  (3)  above.  The  departmental
authorities should takes the necessary action immediately in regard to any
default in making a payment due under any other loan. They should bear in
mind  the  fact  that  a  loan  repayable  with  interest  by  equal  periodical
instalments  will  not  really  be  fully  discharged  by  the  instalments  unless
each is paid punctually on the due date.

       (b)    The authority which sanctions a loan should ordinarily lay down in the
order of sanction the rate of penal interest to be levied on all overdue
instalments of interest or principal and interest.   Penal interest at the
rate of 2.5 per cent per annum over and above the normal rate of interest
would be chargeable whether there is stipulation to the above effect in
the order sanctioning the loan or not.

         *Penal interest at the above said rate will be levied in respect of overdue
instalments of interest or principal and interest and also in the following
cases on non-compliance with the requirement of rules :

299

    (i)      Retention of the loan amount unutilised by the loanee beyond

the normal admissible period;

    (ii)      Retention  of  sale  proceeds  of  motor  car/scooter/motor  cycle

purchased with Government loan beyond the normal admissible

period;

     (iii)     Non-utilisation of loan for the purpose for which it was sanctioned

even when the  loan is repaid to Government in lump within the

normal permissible date;

    (iv)      Delay in the execution of mortgage bond after purchase  of house-

site/house  and  site/motor  conveyance;
300

     (v)     Delay in the production of utilisation certificate as well as completion

certificate;

    (vi)     Delay in  taking comprehensive insurance cover from the State

Insurance Department  and production of insurance policies in

respect of motor car/motor-cycle/scooter advances.

   (vii)    Non-compliance with the requirement of other rules relating to house

construction  advance/motor conveyance advances.

In  all  the  cases  mentioned  above,  penal  interest  at  the  rate  of  2.5%  per

annum, over and above the normal rate of interest would be chargeable on

the  amount  outstanding  inclusive  of  interest  accrued  till  the  recovery  is

completed if the default in complying with the requirements of rules is not

regularised earlier by the competent authority.

              [These orders shall be applicable to loans sanctioned on or after 27-9-1975.]

     (5)    Modification of original terms.— Every borrower should be required to fulfil

strictly the terms settled when his loan was sanctioned. No Government servant

should recommend to the Government or other competent authority a charge in

the original terms for the benefit of a borrower unless there are very special and

exceptional grounds for doing so.

            Loans to Municipalities and to District and other Local Fund Committees

235.        The detailed procedure to be followed in connection with borrowing by local

authorities both from Government and otherwise is laid down in the Kerala

Local Authorities Loans Rules, 1965 and these rules will apply to loans to

Municipalities and other Local Authorities. Rules relating to the execution

of work by the Public Works Department on behalf of local bodies out of

loan funds sanctioned by the Government are contained in Articles 31 to 33

of the Kerala Account Code, Vol. III and Chapter 15 of the Kerala Public

Works Account Code.

Advances to Cultivators

236.

Advances to cultivators include—

           (i)    advances made under the rules issued under the Kerala Agriculturists’

Loans Act, 1961 (Act 27 of 1961) ;

      (ii) any  other  advances  made  to  cultivators  in  connection  with  land

revenue, agriculture or famine under any Act of the Legislature or

under any order of the Government.

Miscellaneous Loans and Advances

237.       Loans (other than loans to Government servants) which do not fall strictly
under any of the other classes mentioned in Article 233 come under this
head, e.g., loans to Government sponsored and other industrial concerns,
loans for the development of large scale, small scale and cottage industries
including handloom and coir industries, loans to Kerala Financial Corporation,
loans for Low Income and Middle Income Group Housing, Colonisation, etc.
The  grant  and  repayment  of  these  loans  are  governed  by  the  general
principles and instructions laid down in Article 234, and the detailed orders
issued  by  Government  from  time  to  time. A  Government  servant  who  is
concerned with the sanction or recovery of any category of loans falling
under this head should keep an up-to-date file of the orders in force regarding
them.

In  the  case  of  a  fully  owned  Government  company/Corporation  which

time of sanctioning the loan. Hypothecation of its assets is also not required
in such cases. It should, however, execute a written undertaking in Form No.
57 before the drawal of the amount of the loan. The stamp duty chargeable
on the undertaking shall be borne by the Government. The countersigning
authority should record on the bill for the drawal of the amount of the loan a
certificate to the effect that the necessary undertaking duly executed by the
loanee has been obtained.

Other advances.

               The Government grant these advances to their servants in accordance with

the Rules contained in Articles 239 to 246.

General Principles

239.     The following general principles and conditions apply to these advances:—

     (1)    No authority may sanction any advance if it would involve a breach of a

standard of financial Propriety (Article 40).

       (2)    Government servants to whom advances may be granted.— As a general rule, no
advance should ordinarily be granted to any Government servant unless he is in
permanent service since the pay of a non-permanent Government servant is
not adequate security for the advance. Advances may, however, be granted
in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  these  rules  to  officiating  or  temporary

In all such cases, a certificate shall be furnished that the Government servant

Repayment.— (a) The principal of an advance should be recovered in equal
monthly instalments by compulsory deductions from the pay of the borrowing
Government servant, beginning with the first payment of a full month’s pay
after the advance is drawn unless otherwise provided in the rules governing
particular  advances,  provided  that  a  borrower  may  repay  two  or  more
instalments at the same time. The amount of the monthly instalments other
than the last should be fixed in whole rupees and in the last instalment the
remaining balance including any fraction of a rupee should be recovered.

   CHAPTER IX ]

LOANS   AND  ADVANCES

                     [ ART.   239

authority may permit the principal and interest of an advance of each kind to
be repaid is indicated in the concerned Articles.

              The recovery of interest should begin with the pay of the next month after
the repayment  of the principal is completed. The interest should be calculated
on the balance outstanding on the last day of each month. If the total amount
of interest to be charged does not appreciably exceed the amount fixed for

the equal monthly instalments for recovery of the principal, it should be

recovered  in  a  single  instalment;  otherwise  it  should  be  recovered  in

instalments not appreciably exceeding that amount.

      (b)        Unless  otherwise  provided  in  the  rules  applicable  to  advances  of  a

particular kind, the amount of the monthly instalments to be recovered

on  account  of  an  advance  should  not  be  changed  by  reason  of  the

borrowing Government servant’s going on any kind of leave with leave

salary. Deductions shall be made from the subsistance allowance on

account of repayment of loans and advances taken from Government at

such rates as the Head of the Department deems appropriate. The whole

amount due should, however, always be completely recovered within

the period originally fixed, unless for exceptionally strong reasons, the

Government sanction a special extension of the period.

      (c)    In the case of officers who are due to retire before the expiry of the

period prescribed for repaying a loan, the instalments of repayment

should be so fixed as to have the loan (principal and interest ) fully

discharged before their retirement.

      (d)     No recovery of the advances will be made during the period of leave

305

cases to that extent, provided however, that the principal and interest

(i) General

240.          No  authority  subordinate  to  the  Government  has  power  to  sanction  any

advance for the purchase of motor conveyance.

        Procedure for Sanction

241.         Every application for an advance, *[from Gazetted Officers] unless otherwise

directed by Government, should be referred to the Accountant General for

remarks as to whether the grant of the advance would involve any departure

from the ordinary rules and what amounts, if any, are outstanding against

the applicant on account of advances of all kinds. *[The applications from

Non-Gazetted Officers shall be verified by the Heads of Officers/Departments

concerned. Date of effect 4-8-1980.]  The sanctioning authority should specify

in the sanction order a date by which the advance should be drawn, which

307

should be within one month of the date of the order sanctioning it and in any

case not later than the close of the current financial year in which it was
sanctioned. If the advance is not drawn within this period, the sanction will

lapse.

242.       These advances are sanctioned subject to the provisions of Articles 239, 240

and 241 and the following rules:—

      (a)     Eligibility of Government servants for an advance.— A Government
servant is not eligible for an advance unless the Government consider
that it is desirable in the interest of the public service that he should
use a motor car in the discharge of his duties.

308

               Only  Government  servants  drawing a pay of not  less than  ** `
2,640 with effect from 1-4-1990 per mensem and holding posts which
entail duties involving touring or to whom the Government have
granted a conveyance allowance for the maintenance of a motor car
for the discharge of their duties are eligible for the advance. # But
those  officers  having  less  than  two  years  of  service  for
superannuation on the date of receipt of application in the Finance
Department will not be eligible for Motor Car Advance.

     Note:— For the purposes of these rules, Officers who have to move
about frequently within the limits of the Trivandrum City may be
regarded as touring officers.

   (b)     Conditions under which an advance is granted.—  The grant of an

advance is subject to the following conditions:—

        (1)    A Government servant is not eligible for an advance on account of
a motor car which he has already taken delivery unless the application
is  made  within  three  months  from  the  date  of  purchase  of  the
conveyance.

       Note:— If a Government servant on duty who has applied for an advance
from the Government has a favourable opportunity for buying a

suitable car he may take delivery of it on payment of the whole or

any portion of its purchase price, to be recouped later from the

advance already applied for,  if and when the Government sanction

it.

          (2)†[The  amount  to  be  advanced  to  an  officer  shall  not  exceed
*` 40,000 (Rupees Forty thousand only) with effect from 1-4-1983
or  20  months  substantive  pay  or  the  amount  applied  for,  or  the

anticipated price of the car, whichever is least.]  Government may,

however, base the amount at their discretion on the officiating pay,

instead  of  substantive  pay,  when  an  officer  is  acting    in  an

appointment or in a grade from length of time during the period of

repayment. If the actual price paid is less than the advance taken,

the balance should be refunded to Government forthwith.

Pay in respect of provisional appointments may be treated as officiating pay

for this purpose and taken into account for calculating the eligible amount of

advance, provided such appointments have been continuing for a period of

twelve months and where Government consider that there is little chance of

the officer being reverted to a lower post.

       Note 1:— The term actual price includes the price of such items which have

necessarily  to  be  purchased  along  with  the  motor  conveyance  (or  in

other words, on the purchase of which the purchaser has no choice),

e.g., spare wheel, tyre and tube, pillion seat in a scooter. Where, however,

certain accessories (e.g., radio in a car, plastic covers) are purchased

which are not essential and which the customer purchases of his own

volition,  the term ‘actual price’ will not cover their cost. Insurance and

309

registration charges which are incurred for running the motor vehicle

cannot be included in the actual price of the vehicle.

Service Rules will also be taken into account for fixing the eligibility of an

officer, provided the officer is likely to draw the special pay during the

period of repayment of the advance.

    Note 3:—  D.P. will be reckoned for the purpose of calculating the amount of

advance admissible under these rules.

     (3)      When the Government sanction an advance to a Government servant

who is on leave or is about to proceed on leave, the advance may be

drawn  at  any  time  during  the  currency  of  the  leave  if  he  receives

310

intimation regarding the availability of the conveyance while he is on

leave. If in any such case the restriction  in Article 241 operates the

sanction order may be renewed.

    (4)       Except when an officer proceeds on leave for a period of four months

and over or retires from service, or is transferred to an appointment the

duties of which do not render the possession of a motor car necessary,

he may not without the Government’s previous sanction, sell a car

purchased with the aid of an advance which, with the interest on it in

accordance with Article 239 (3) and (4)  has not been fully repaid. If

a  Government  servant  wishes  to  transfer  such  a  car  to  another

Government servant who performs duties of a kind that renders the

possession of the conveyance necessary the Government may permit

the  transfer  of  the  liability  attaching  to  the  car  to  the  latter

Government servant, provided that he records a declaration that he

is aware that the conveyance transferred to him remains subject to

the mortgage bond and that he is bound by its terms and provisions.

     (5)     Whenever a Government servant sells a car before completing the

repayment  of  an  advance  received  from  the  Government  for  its

purchase with the interest on it in accordance with Article 239  (3)

and    (4),  he  should  apply  the  sale  proceeds  so  far  as  may  be

necessary, towards the repayment  of the outstanding balance due
to the Government. If, however, the borrower sells the car only in

order to purchase another car the Government may permit him to

apply  the  sale  proceeds  towards  such  purchase  subject  to  the

following conditions:—

      (i)     If  the amount outstanding exceeds the cost of the new car,

the  Government  servant  should  repay  the  excess  to  the

Government immediately.

       (ii)    the Government servant should continue to repay the amount

outstanding by the  monthly instalments already fixed; and

       (iii)     the new car should be insured or mortgaged to the Government

as required by these  rules. The mortgage bond need be only

for the outstanding  balance due under the original mortgage

and should be executed in Form No. 27A.

        (6)      If  on  sale  of  a  motor  car  as  contemplated  in  clause  5  above,  a

Government employee is in actual need of a second advance for
the purchase of a new car and applies for it, he may be given an

additional  advance  for  the  purchase  subject  to  the  following

conditions:—

       (i)      The second advance will be restricted to the excess of the price

of the newly purchased  car over the sale proceeds of the old

car provided the second advance plus the balance outstanding

in respect of the original advance previously granted should

311

not exceed  the price of the newly purchased car and the limits

prescribed in clause (2) above.

    (ii)    The Government servant should continue to repay the amount
outstanding under the original advance plus the amount of the
second advance in monthly instalments at the rates fixed by the
Government.

the original mortgage  plus the amount of the second advance

and should be executed in Form No. 27B.

         Note:— The officers applying for second advance should state in the

loan  application  the  probable  price  of  the  car  proposed  to  be

purchased,  probable  amount  by  way  of  sale  proceeds  of  the  car

purchased with the earlier advance and the balance amount required

advance  only  after  the  lapse  of  **fifteen  years  from  the  date  of

drawal of the previous advance and the previous advance is fully

repaid with interest. Applications for second advances should be

sent  through  the Accountant  General  who  will  forward  them  to

Government with a certificate that the previous advance has been

fully adjusted.

   (8)         An officer drawing the advance is liable to pay penal interest at 2.5

per cent over and above the usual rate of interest on the balance of

the principal amount outstanding from time to time from the due

date of execution of the bond till the date of its final execution,  if he

fails to execute the mortgage deed within the prescribed period,

viz., one month from the date of drawal of the advance. Government

reserve the right to exempt the loanees  from the operation of the

penal clause if they are able to show that the delay for the excecution
of the bond is occasioned by circumstances beyond their control.

will also be levied in cases of belated/defaulted repayment of the

   (9)         If an officer who has taken the advance dies while in service before

the final settlement of the advance, no interest will be recoverable

on  the  principal  amount  of  outstanding  advance  proposed  to  be

adjusted from the insurance amount and/or gratuity for any period

beyond the date of death of the loanee. The amounts due on the

insurance policy/policies assigned in favour of Government and

the gratuity should be realised and adjusted to the extent necessary

for the final settlement of the advance amount as early as possible

after the death of the officer who has taken the advance.

(10) (i) The date of drawal of advance will be the date of issue of cheques

when  payment  of  the  conveyance  advance  is  made  by  personal

cheque and the date of actual drawal or disbursement in the other

cases of Gazetted Officers/Non-Gazetted Officers. To enable the

Audit Officer to know the month from which the recovery should

start, the Head of Office should invariably intimate the date of such

disbursement  promptly  to  the  concerned  audit  officer.  It  should

also be ensured that the time-lag between the date of drawal of a

cheque and its disbursement by the Head of Office is reduced to

the minimum.

        (ii)   The period of one month laid down in the rule will be a calendar

month from the date of drawal of the advance.

        (iii)   When the period of one month provided under the rules is extended

313

by competent authority the penal interest will be charged with
effect from the date following that on which the extended period

expires.

bond in the prescribed form after buying the car and should also insure

the car against full loss by fire, theft or accident.

        (c)      Repayment.— (1) Particulars of repayment of the advance will be determined

by the sanctioning authority in the manner specified under the rules and will

be indicated in the order sanctioning the loan. Ordinarily the whole amount
of principal shall be recovered in †144 monthly instalments with effect from
1-4-1983  and interest as indicated in sub-rule (4) of Article 239.

      (2)   In cases where the recovery could not be effected in  †144 monthly
instalments with effect from 1-4-1983 before the normal date of retirement

314

the rate of recovery may be so fixed as to effect recovery at the normal

rate till the date of retirement of the loanee, the balance being recovered

the time of retirement subject, however, to the following:—

       (i)     that he agree to the incorporation of a suitable clause in the prescribed

agreement  and the mortgage deed to the effect that the Government

shall be entitled to recover  the balance of the said advance with interest

remaining unpaid at the time of his  retirement or death preceding

retirement from the whole or any specified part of the  gratuity that may

be admissible to him, and

       (ii)       that he has not availed himself of and will not be availing himself of this

facility in  respect of house construction advance taken or to be taken

by him.

#[that this has been verified and found correct] and forward it to the

Government in the Finance Department through the Accountant General,

who will certify as to ‘whether the grant of the advance would involve

any departure from the ordinary rules, etc., (See Article 241).  If for any

reason,  the  sanctioning  authority  has  to  return  the  application  for

correction,  the  Government  servant  should  re-submit  the  revised

application through the Head of the Department, who should certify as

to its correctness and through the Accountant General, who will again

certify as to whether  the grant of the  advance would involve any

departure from the ordinarily rules  etc.  @The applicant eligible for the

and take delivery of the car within one month from the date of drawing

the advance; otherwise he should repay to the Government at once the

full amount of the advance drawn with interest on it for one month. If

he completes the transaction with in one month allowed, he should

bond. The sanctioning authority should see that the borrower completes

the  transaction  within  the  time  allowed  or  makes  the  necessary

repayment immediately on its expiry. If he duly completes the transaction

in time, the sanctioning authority should see that he immediately submits

the  necessary  mortgage  bond  duly  executed  and  should  transmit  it

promptly to the Accountant General for scrutiny. It should after such

scrutiny be forwarded to the Head of the Department or the District

Treasury Officer, as the case may be, for custody. When the advance

had been fully repaid, the bond should be returned to the Government

servant concerned, duly cancelled, after obtaining a certificate from

the Accountant General as to the complete repayment of the advance

and interest.

         Note 1:— The stamp duty on account of execution of the mortgage bond

will be borne by the Government.

           Note 2:— The advance should be drawn only after the Government servant

concerned has received a written assurance from the motor car dealer

that the supply is likely to be available within a month and a certificate

to this effect should also be recorded on the bill for the advance. In the

event of any delay in supply despite the written assurance given by

the dealer, the Government servant should apply within the permissible

period of one month for extension of the time limit for taking  delivery of

the car,  supported by a letter from the dealer indicating the probable

period of supply and seek permission for retaining the advance amount

for that period. The requests will be considered by Government on the

merits of each case.

          Note 3:— A State Government servant who is sent on deputation exceeding

12 months out of India before an advance drawn by him for the purchase

of  a  Motor  Car  is  completely  repaid  by  him,  may  at  his  option,  be

allowed by Government to repay the remaining instalments in rupees in

India. The Government servant should arrange to remit the amount
due  by  bank  draft  by  the  15th,  of  every  month  in  favour  of  the

Accountant General, Kerala. A second mortgage deed shall be obtained

from the Government servant to this effect in Form 27C and the office

to which he is attached abroad informed accordingly. If the bank draft

is not received by the Accountant General before the end of the month,

he would immediately report the matter to Government in the Finance

Department and also to the office abroad where the Government servant

is working, for further necessary action.  Failure on the part of the

Government servant to remit the bank draft by the due date will render

him liable to pay penal interest in accordance with the provisions in

these rules, and on return of the officer, any amount left unrecovered

will be deducted as before from his monthly pay bills by the Accountant

General.

     (4)      The mortgage bond to be executed by a Government servant who draws

an advance provides that he shall keep the car insured against full loss or

damage by fire, theft or accident. He should effect the necessary insurance
within one month from the date of purchase of the car or within one month

from the date of drawal of the advance whichever is later. The insurance

in such cases should be arranged with the Kerala State Government

Insurance Department.

               Form of the clause to be inserted in policies is as follows:-

said pledgee as long as they are the pledgee of the ..............................and
their receipt shall be full and final discharge to the Government in respect of
such loss or damage.

Save by this Endorsement expressly agreed nothing herein shall modify or
affect the rights or liabilities of the Insured or the Government respectively
under or in connection with this policy or any term, provision of condition
thereof.”

318

                The Government servant should also send direct to the Accountant General
the insurance cover notes or the insurance policies. The Accountant General
will bring to the notice of Government any case in which the insurance has
not been effected within the period specified above. If the borrower fails to
insure the car within the prescribed period, he should refund the whole of the
advance with the interest that has accrued on it unless good reason is shown
to the contrary. The amount for which the car is insured during any period
should  not  be  less  than  the  outstanding  balance  of  the  advance  with  the
interest that has accrued at the beginning of that period and the insurance
should be renewed from time to time until the amount due is completely
repaid. If at any time and for any reason the amount for which the car is
actually insured is less than the outstanding balance of the advance including
the interest that has already accrued, the Government servant should refund
the difference to the Government in not more than three monthly instalments.

                The Accountant General should, whenever the policy is about to fall due for
renewal,  so  long  as  any  amount  remains  outstanding  on  account  of  the
advance, require the borrower to produce his receipt for the renewal premium
on each such occasion before the date on which the policy is due for renewal,
and should scrutinise it to see that it is in order.

      (5)     All motor conveyances purchased with the advance sanctioned by
Government should be compulsorily insured with the State Insurance
Department.

      (6)       Officers who have been granted advances for the purchase of conveyances
should furnish the prescribed securities within two months from the date

of issue of the authority for payment of the advance. If the documents are

not  furnished  to  the Accountant  General  and  finally  accepted  by  him

within a period of two months, the Accountant General may order recovery

of the advance in a lump.

      (e)      Advances to Government servants on Foreign Service.— When a Government

servant who is on foreign service requires an advance for the purchase of a

motor car he should apply to the  foreign employer to grant it from its funds.  If

the  foreign  employer  wishes  to  grant  the  advance,  he  should  apply  to  the

Government for their sanction. If the Government accord their sanction, it will be

subject to the proviso that the advance by the foreign employer shall be regulated

by the same conditions as would apply to an advance  by the Government. In

special cases, however, where an Officer’s services have been lent to a local

body  or  statutory  corporation  or  industrial  or  commercial  corporation  or    a

company  owned  by  Government  or  in  which  Government  have  controlling

interest,  whose financial position will not permit of the advance being made
from its funds, the Government may, at their discretion sanction advances

from the State Funds under these rules provided the officer’s duties are such

as to render the possession of a motor car a practical necessity.

    CONDITIONS  UNDER  WHICH  ADVANCE  IS  SANCTIONED

SECTION  A

General

244C. (i)       Advances for the purposes mentioned as items 1 to 4 under article 244 will
not  be  sanctioned  to  a  Government  servant(s)  who  own(s)  a  house
anywhere in the country either in his/her/their name(s) or in the name of
his wife/her husband/their minor children *and to those having less than
two years of service for superannuation on the date of sanctioning.

324

                      While applying for the advance the applicant (s) should make a declaration

in the following form in the application.

                   “I/We do not already own a house anywhere in the country either in my
name/our names or in the name of my wife/husband or in the name of my/
our minor children.”

           Note.—  Government may relax this provision in exceptional cases where
they are satisfied that the house proposed to be built is required for the
bonafide residence of the applicant and that it will be impossible for the
applicant to reside in his existing house for reasons other than of its

having already been let out on rent, or being situated at a place other

than the place of his work.

         (ii)     Loans under more than one housing scheme will not be sanctioned to an

applicant/applicants.

         (iii)      Not more than two advances will be given  to a Government servant(s)

during the entire period of his/her/their service.

           (iv)     The grant of the second advance is, however, subject to the condition that

the Government servant(s) is/are obliged, for reasons beyond control, to

dispose of the house constructed  or purchased out of the first advance and

    [ ART. 244C

that the first advance has been completely repaid by deductions from the
salary or out of the sale realisation of the house which had to be sold by
the Government servant(s), or partly by deductions and partly by sale
realisation.

          (v)      The Government servant selling the house constructed with the advance
from Government should convince Government/the sanctioning authority
of  the  necessity  for  the  same  and  obtain  prior  sanction.    The  whole  or
balance of the advance outstanding against the Government servant on this
account with interest remaining unpaid shall become payable in lump on the
date of sale or immediately thereafter.

        (vi)     More than one advance shall not be made for the same house and no
officer may receive a second advance while any portion of a previous
advance (including interest thereon) is outstanding against him except
as otherwise provided in these rules.

            (vii)    The  maximum  amount  of  advance  admissible  shall  not  exceed
** ` 1,00,000 (Rupees One lakh only) or fifty times the basic pay of an
officer/officers  (on  joint  salary  basis)  or  the  amount  applied  for
whichever is least.

                    Note 1:— Dearness pay will also be reckoned for the purpose of calculating
the maximum amount of advance admissible to  an officer under this rule.

               Note 2:—  The computation of the loan amount on the basis of officiating
pay will be made in the case of an officer having  substantive appointment,
only if the concerned Head of Department, certifies that he is not likely to
be reverted  to a post having a lower scale of pay during the period of
repayment of the loan.

325

      Pay in  respect of provisional appointments may be treated as officiating
pay for this purpose and taken into account for calculating the eligible
amount of advance, provided such appointments have been continuing

for a period of twelve months and where Government or the sanctioning
authority consider(s) that there is little chance of the officer being reverted
to a lower post.

          (viii)    All such advances must be for bona fide requirements for the purchase of
or  building  suitable  houses  for  the  personal  residence  of  the  officers
concerned and if more is advanced than what is actually expended for the
purpose, the surplus shall be refunded to Government.  Advance may be
made either in one instalment or in instalments as considered desirable.

          (ix)      Repayment of the advance shall commence from the first instalment of pay
after the expiry of 9 months from the date of  disbursement or the date of
disbursement  of  the  last  instalment,  as  the  case  may  be  or  the  date  of

326

completion of the building whichever is earlier.  (This concession is not

admissible to those who purchase a built house outright.  The recovery in

such cases will commence with the first issue of pay after disbursement of

the advance.

             (x)        Particulars of recoveries to be made from the borrower will be determined

by  the sanctioning authority in the manner specified under the rules and
will be indicated in the order sanctioning the loan.  The whole amount of

principal and interest shall be recovered in not more than 216 monthly

instalments.

     In the case of officers who are due to retire before the expiry of the above

normal period of recovery, the instalments of repayment should be so fixed

that the loan and interest thereon are fully discharged before their retirement.

Provided that the recovery of the advance with interest in such cases may be

made in convenient  monthly instalments ( the amount of which should not

be  less  than  the  amount  of  monthly  instalment  on  the  basis  of  the  full
period of repayment admissible under the rules) during the remaining

period of his service and provided also that he agrees to  the incorporation

of a suitable clause in the prescribed agreement and the mortgage deed

to the effect that the Government shall be entitled to recover the balance

of the said advance with interest remaining unpaid at the time of his

retirement or death preceding retirement, from the whole or any specified

part of the gratuity that may be sanctioned to him.  Provided further that

where a part of the advance or interest is to be wiped off by adjustment

from gratuity the amount actually adjusted will be deemed to have been

remitted on the date of retirement/death of the loanee, and no interest

will accrue on the amount so adjusted beyond the date of retirement/

death.

          (xi)      Instalments of recoveries will be so fixed as not to contain fractions of a

rupee. Fractions of rupee occurring in the calculation of interest will be

included in the last instalment of interest.

          (xii)     Advances will be recovered at the rate prescribed in clause (x) above or

at a higher rate if the officer receiving the advance so desires in writing

by compulsory monthly deduction from the bill for the salary or leave

allowance of the officer.

          (xiii)    Interest will be recovered in one or more instalments, each such instalment

being  not  appreciably  greater  or  less  than  the  instalments  by  which  the

principal was recovered. The recovery of interest will commence from the

month following that in which the last instalment towards repayment of

principal is due.  If for any reason interest due cannot be worked out finally,

recovery should be made provisionally at the rate fixed for the recovery of

the principal.

327
        (xiv)   If for any reason, no salary is drawn by the officer in any month or

months, the payment of the usual instalments must nevertheless be
made by him.  However, during full months of leave without allowance

no recovery will be made and the repayment will be postponed to that

extent, provided the principal and interest are fully repaid before the

officer retires from service.

       (xv) (a) In order to secure Government from loss consequent on an officer dying

or  quitting  the  service  before  complete  repayment  of  the  advance,  the

house  together  with  the  land  it  standing  upon  must  be  mortgaged  to

Government by whom the mortgage will be released on repayment of the

full amount of the advance together with interest thereon.

               (b)  The borrower should assign in addition to the land and building any one

of the following as collateral security.

328

       (1)    A Life Insurance Policy taken by the loanee in the office branch of the

State Insurance Department or in the Life Insurance Corporation of

India or in the Postal Insurance for an amount sufficient to cover 25%

of the amount of the loan.

      Note 1.— The Policy should be absolutely assigned to the Governor of

Kerala in Form No. 35.  The assignment of policy of Life Insurance

will be made by an endorsement in the prescribed form upon the

policy itself or by a separate instrument signed by the assignor or his

duly authorised agent and attested by at least one witness specifically

setting forth the fact of assignment.  If the assignment is not made by

endorsement on the policy, the assignment will be in the Assignment

Deed form prescribed.

       Note 2.— In cases where the total value of the house constructed and the

property hypothecated to Government alone with it as security for

the loan exceeds the amount of the loan outstanding repayment by

100%,  the  insurance  policy/policies  pledged  to  Government  as

collateral security will be reassigned in Form 52 A in favour of the

loanees, on request in writing.

      (2)    Gratuity/death-cum-retirement gratuity to the extent of 25% of the loan.

           Note 1.— An assignment may be made by a Government servant of his

gratuity/death-cum-retirement gratuity in Form 35 A towards payment

of the advance to him by Government under the rules.  The amount of

328

CHAPTER IX ]

LOANS   AND  ADVANCES

  [ ART.  244C

gratuity deemed to be available for this purpose would be the amount
due to the applicant on the date of his superannuation/at the time of

retirement calculated on the basis of the appointment held by the

applicant at the time of submitting his application for the grant of the

advance.  The amount so worked out should be not less than 25% of

the advance applied for.

          Note 2.— In the case of non-Gazetted Officers the fact of assignment of

death-cum-retirement gratuity as collateral security will be recorded

in their service books and a certificate to that effect will be attached

to the bill claiming the amount of advance.  In the case of Gazetted

Officers,  Heads  of  Departments  concerned  will  intimate  the

Accountant-General that the death-cum-retirement gratuity of the

officer  stands  mortgaged  to  Government  and  a  copy  of  the

communication will be attached to the bill claiming the amount of

advance.

    (3)       Insurance against fire in the State Insurance Department for a sum

not less than the amount of the advance.

              Immediately on completion of construction or purchase of the house,
and in any case within two months thereafter the Government Officer
concerned  should  insure  the  house  at  his  own  cost  with  the  State
Insurance Department for a sum not less than the amount of advance
and keep it so insured against damage by fire, flood or lightning till the
advance is fully repaid to Government, and keep  the policy with the
head of Department concerned or the Board of Revenue as the case may
be.  The premium must be paid regularly and premium receipts produced
for inspection by the Head of Department/ the Board of Revenue.  They
should obtain from the Government Officer drawing the advance, a
letter to the State Insurance Department notifying to the latter the
fact that the Government are interested in the Insurance policy and
forward it to insurer and obtain his acknowledgement.  In the case of

insurance effected on  annual basis, this process should be repeated
every year until the advance is fully repaid to Government.  The Head
of Department/Board of Revenue should furnish to the Accountant-
General an annual certificate that the conditions prescribed in this
clause have been fulfilled.

            (c)    The borrower should also produce an encumbrance certificate for 12 years in

respect of the landed property furnished as security.

       (xvi)     The officer must satisfy the sanctioning authority regarding his title to
the land upon which the house is or is proposed to the built and in the
case of purchase of house or house site, that the proposed vendor has
got clear title to the property which has been agreed to be sold to the
applicant by the vendor.

330

        Note.— This rule does not preclude the grant of an advance to a person

who does not possess proprietary rights on the land upon which he

intends to build, provided that the Government are satisfied that the

interest which he has in the land is such as to justify the grant of the

advance.

        (xvii)      An officer quitting or removed from a station where he has built a house,

before the whole amount of the advance has been liquidated, will continue

to be liable to the deduction of the monthly instalment until the advance

is fully repaid, but with the special sanction of the Government he may be

allowed to dispose of the house, provided he is thereby enabled to clear

off at once the whole amount due, or to transfer it to any officer of his own

or higher rank, the further deductions being made from the salary of such

an officer.

    (xviii)   Applications  for  advances  should  be  made  in  Form  29  through  the

applicant’s departmental superior, who will record his opinion as to

the necessity of the assistance.

330

   [ ART.  244C

        (xix)      The applicant must declare that the amount will be expended only for the
purpose for which it is applied for and pledge  himself that surplus funds

if any will at once be refunded to Government.

         (xx)     The grant of advances is always subject to budget provision.  If an advance

which has been sanctioned has not been disbursed before the close of the

financial year in which it is sanctioned the applicant will have to get the

sanction renewed in the following year if he still wants the loan.

        (xxi)       The loan amount should be utilised for the purpose for which it is granted

within a reasonable time not exceeding one year from the date of full

disbursement of the loan.

     (xxii)     In case the applicant commits breach of any of the conditions under

which  an  advance  is  sanctioned  the  entire  amount  advanced  with

interest shall become payable in a lump and shall be recoverable under

the provisions of the Revenue Recovery Act.

    (xxiii)     In the case of advances for purchase of site with house an amount not

exceeding 25% of the value of the site with house may also be granted for
repairs at the time of the purchase subject to the condition that the overall

loan amount does not exceed the maximum amount for which the applicant

is eligible at the time of application.  The application in such cases should

be accompanied by an estimate or repairs duly certified by the Assistant

Engineer (Buildings and Roads) having jurisdiction over the area in which

the site is situated.

331
    (xxiv)     In the case of advances for the purchase of site with house and repairs

thereto the advance will be disbursed in two instalments, the first instalment

being equal to the value of the house and site and the second being  the
balance  amount  which  will  be  disbursed  only  after  the  property  is

mortgaged to Government.

     (xxv)        In the case of mortgage deeds executed by an officer, whether Gazetted or

non-gazetted, whether independently or jointly with his/her/wife/husband,

towards security for the house construction advance of any of the different

kinds  sanctioned  to  him/her/them,  the  stamp  duty  chargeable  will  be

entirely remissioned.  The remission of stamp duty will be available even

when the mortgage deeds are executed by the Government employees

jointly with others who are not Government employees.

    (xxvi)       The applicant should furnish along with the application for advance a plan

of the building proposed to be constructed or purchased by him and a

332

certificate from the Village Officer concerned regarding the location of the

site with reference to the nearest road, Survey No., Village and the detailed

address of the owners of the adjoining properties.  These records may be

passed on, duly countersigned by the Head of Office, to the Executive

Engineer having jurisdiction over the area in which the site is situated

with a request for valuation. They need not be sent to Government along

with the application, in cases where Government are competent to sanction

the advance.  But the Head of the Department should state in his certificate
recorded in the application that the certificate from the Village Officer and

the plan of the building have been  obtained from the applicant (s).  In

cases where the Head of the Department himself is competent to sanction

the advance, he should obtain the records and keep them with him.

                Note.— Since the purpose of the valuation is only to ensure proper utilisation

of  the  loan  amount  an  approximate  valuation  by  the  Public  Works

Department (Building and Roads Branch) will be sufficient.

      (xxvii)   In the last pay certificate granted to officers the original amount of such

advance,  the  amount  repaid  and  the  balance  remaining  due  should  be

specified.

         3.  CALCULATION  OF  DEATH-CUM-RETIREMENT GRATUITY

                 The Head of Department concerned and the Secretary, Board of Revenue in

the case of Heads of Departments shall work out roughly the gratuity/death-

cum-retirement  gratuity  payable  to  the  officer  under  the  service  rules

applicable  to  him  as  well  as  the  principal  and  interest  that  would  be

outstanding recovery on the normal date of retirement of the applicant.  The

basis for working out the gratuity/death-cum-retirement gratuity will be the

appointment held by the applicant at the time of submitting the application.

For  purposes  of  calculating  the  death-cum-retirement  gratuity  adjustable

towards the outstanding advance amount and interest the pay that will be

taken  into  account  is  such  pay  including  dearness  pay  as  he  would  be

eligible for at the time of retirement had he continued in the same appointment.

For the purpose of calculating the principal and  interest, it will be assumed

that  the  Government  servant  can  generally  commence  repayment  of  the

advance  one  year  after  the  date  of  application  of  the  advance  if  it  is  for

purchase of site and/or construction of a building and six months after date

of  application  if  it  is  for  outright  purchase  of  a  built  house.   All  such
applications from Gazetted Officers should be routed to Government through

the Accountant General.  The actual amount to be sanctioned and that to be

adjusted from gratuity/death-cum-retirement gratuity as also the amount to

be recovered in monthly instalments will be determined by the sanctioning

authority in the manner specified under the rules and will be indicated in the

order sanctioning the loan.

Note 1:— The applicant should furnish a declaration in the application form

341

that he agrees to adjust a portion of the advance (amount to  be specified)

from the gratuity/death-cum-retirement gratuity admissible to him.

Note 2:— The Heads of Departments/Secretary, Board of Revenue should

certify in the application form “that the amount of gratuity/death-cum-

retirement  gratuity  due  to  the  applicant  on  the  date  of  his

appointment  held  by  the  applicant  at  the  time  of  submitting  the
application is estimated to be `......................... and that the applicant is
governed by K.S.R./A.I.S. Rules”.

                 RULES  REGARDING  THE  PROCEDURE  ON

RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS

244E. (i) Except in the case of advances requiring sanction of the Government in the

Finance Department application from non-gazetted officers for advance shall

be submitted through the Head of Office concerned who will forward it to the

342

authority competent to sanction it.  In the case of advance requiring sanction

of the Government in the Finance Department, application for advance shall

be submitted through the Head of the Department concerned who will forward

it to the Government in the Finance Department direct in the case of Non-

gazetted Officers and through the Accountant General in the case of Gazetted

Officers.  The Head of the Department will forward along with the application

certificate in Form 37.  He shall satisfy himself as to the sufficiency of the

security offered in each case and shall while forwarding the  application

record his  opinion as to the extent of the amount  that may be advanced

without risk to Government. When the applicant is himself the Head of a

Department,  he  shall  forward  the  application  to  the Accountant  General

through the Board of Revenue who shall certify as to the sufficiency of the

security offered.  Application for cancellation of loans already sanctioned

shall  likewise  be  forwarded  to  the  sanctioning  authority  through  the

Accountant  General  in  all  cases.     Applications  shall  be  received  by  the

Accountant General only till the end of December each year.

Note 1:—   The procedure to be followed in the case of applications of the
Heads of Departments will also apply to those  of the Secretaries to
Government including the Chief Secretary, Additional Secretaries and
Joint Secretaries,  Registrar of High Court and the Secretary to the
Kerala Public Service Commission.

342

   [ ART. 244E

     Note 2:—   The Head of the Department will record his opinion as to the
sufficiency of the security on the basis of the  valuation made by the
Revenue Department in the case of advances for purchase of site.  If
the advance is for  the construction of a house, it should be got valued
by  the  Public  Works  Department  on  completion.    References    for
valuation to the Public Works Department may be made to the Executive
Engineer (Buildings and Roads)  and those to the Revenue Department
to the District Collector concerned.

      Note 3:—   In the case of applications for purchase of site with building the
Head of the office or Department, as the case  may be, will forward the
applications  to  the  sanctioning  authority  without  the    certificate  of
sufficiency  of    security,  but  take  action  simultaneously  to  get  the
property valued by the Public Works Department and the  Revenue
Department.  He will obtain and file the certificate of valuation and
inform the Accountant General  accordingly before the time fixed for
mortgaging the property expires.  If the value fixed by the Public Works
Department and the Revenue Department together falls short of the
loan amount, excess will be recovered from  the applicant immediately
in a lump.

        (ii)    On sanctioning the loan or on receipt of Government orders sanctioning the
loan,  the  disbursing  authority  concerned  should  get  the  security  bond
executed and obtain all the documents specified by Government Pleader in
support of the clear title certificate.  He should then arrange for all these
documents being kept under safe custody along with the mortgage deed.  In
the  case  of  the  loans  granted  to  the  Heads  of  Departments,  all  these
documents should be transmitted to the Principal Sub-treasury, Trivandrum
by the Secretary, Board of Revenue, for safe custody.  The details of the
documents obtained should be noted on the right hand side of the Register
of Advances to Government Employees for buildings repairing or purchasing
houses (Form 38) and attested by the Head of the Department/the Secretary,

343

Board of Revenue as the case may be.

 [ ART.  244E

The Head of Department or the Secretary, Board of Revenue, as the case

may  be,  will  be  held  personally  responsible  in  the  matter  of  keeping  the

documents  under  safe  custody.    He  can,  however,  nominate  the  Chief

Ministerial Officer or the Superintendent-in-charge of Establishment Section/

the Sub Treasury Officer, Principal Sub Treasury, Trivandrum to assist him in

this matter.  The documents pertaining to each loan should be kept in one

cover or folder with a label on the outside giving details of the contents.  An

annual  verification  of  the  documents  should  also  be  made  and  the  fact

recorded in the register.

344

                The Head of Department or the Secretary, Board of Revenue, as the case

may be, should also see that the insurance policies are kept alive and the

insurance amount is adjusted to the loan account, if the policy matures

during  the  period  of  repayment  of  advances.    In  the  case  of  policies

where the premia are paid by deduction from salary bills or otherwise the

loanee  should  satisfy  his  immediate  superior  authority  once  in  every

three months that the premia have been remitted and policy is kept alive.

The immediate superior in turn will report the fact to the Head of the
Department who will make the necessary entries in the remarks column of

the registers of advances maintained in his office, duly attested.   Such

reports should be sent to the Accountant General in respect of advances

sanctioned to officers who are deputed on foreign service conditions.

This proceedure should be followed in order to see that statutory dues such

as property tax, land revenue, michavaram, etc., are paid in time and the

property offered as security is kept unencumbered.

      Note:— In deserving cases, Government will have the discretion to re-assign

such insurance policies to the loanee before complete repayment of the

advance with interest, irrespective of the consideration  whether they

have matured or not, provided the amount of other insurance policies,

if any, assigned in favour of Government will cover  an amount not less

344

CHAPTER IX ]

 [ ART.  244E

than  25%  of  the  outstanding  amount  of  the  advance  with  interest
thereon at the time when the loanee requests for the re-assignment of

the insurance policy/policies.

    *(iii)   The Head of Department/sanctioning authority shall authorise the Head

of Office/Drawing Officer and disburse the advance to the applicant on

proper  acquittance.  The  sanctioning  authority  will  specify  the  fact  of

authorisation in the sanction itself to enable the Treasury Officer to make
payment to the Head of Office/Drawing Officer concerned on the authority
of that sanction. Accordingly the Head of Officer/Drawing Officer should
follow the normal procedure of presenting the bills for drawal of House
Building Advance at the Treasury through the Treasury bill book. In the
case of joint loans a declaration shall be obtained along with application
from either of the applicants authorising the other to receive payment in
case the advance applied for is sanctioned by competent authority.

              # A certified copy of the sanction should be attached to the bill.

       (iv)   Payment of the advances shall not be made unless the Head of Department/
Sanctioning authority, as the case may be certifies that all relevant document
such as title deed, mortgage deed, collateral security etc., have been obtained
and kept under safe custody.

               In the case of Heads of Departments the above certificate will be furnished

by the Secretary, Board of Revenue.

obtain from the loanees non-encumbrance certificates of the properties along
with the mortgage deeds, if the sale deed in favour of the loanees and the
mortgage deeds in favour of Government are not executed simultaneously
on the same day.  Such non-encumbrance certificates should cover the period
from the date of sale of the property by the Board in favour of the loanees to
the  date  of  execution  of  the  mortgage  deed  by  the  loanees  in  favour  of
Government and these certificates should be kept under safe custody along
with the other documents.

      (vi)  It will be the duty of the Head of the Department/Sanctioning authority/

346

officer concerned to see that the amount of loan is properly utilised within a

reasonable time not exceeding one year from the date of full disbursement of

the  loan  and  to  take  steps  for  the  recovery  of  the  outstanding  balances

under  the  provisions  of  the  mortgage  deed.    When  the  loan  is  disbursed

before  the  house  is  constructed,  the  Head  of  the  Department  concerned

must  ascertain  the  actual  value  of  the  building  completed  and  see  to  the
refund of the balance of the loan that may remain unspent.  This will be done

by the Board of Revenue in the case of Heads of Departments etc., mentioned

in Note I under Article 244E. (i).

When House Construction Advance is sanctioned to an applicant to whom

a  plot  of  land  is  allotted  by  the  Kerala  State  Housing  Board,  the  Officer

responsible to watch the utilisation of the loan amount, should intimate the

Board that Government are interested in the land allotted to the loanee as

well as in the building proposed to be constructed.  He should also request

the Kerala State Housing Board to intimate him in due course the execution

of the sale deed in favour of the loanee to enable him to watch the timely

execution of the mortgage deed of the property by the loanee in favour of

Government.

In cases where advances are sanctioned for constructing of houses on plots

of land allotted by the Kerala State Housing Board, the Heads of Departments

responsible for watching the utilisation of the advance, should obtain from

346

CHAPTER IX ]

 [ ART.  244E

the loanees, before disbursement of the advance, documentary evidence to
prove that the cost of the land has been paid in full to the board and furnish

a certificate to that effect along with the bill.  In cases where advances are

sanctioned for purchase of land allotted by the Kerala State Housing Board

and construction of houses thereon, such documentary evidence should be

obtained from the loanees within a period of two months from the date of

disbursement of the advance.

Along with the utilisation certificate, the officers responsible for watching

the utilisation of the loan amount, should obtain from the loanees a certificate

issued  by  the  Kerala  State  Housing  Board  that  the  house  has  been

constructed according to the approved plan.

The  officer  responsible  for  watching  the  utilisation  of  the  loan  amount,

should forward utilisation certificates of loans to the Accountant General

within three months from the date fixed for the production of the utilisation

certificate.

It is also the duty of the Head of the Department/sanctioning authority to

ensure  that  the  property  mortgaged  to  Government  is  kept  free  of  any

encumbrance throughout the period of repayment of the loan. He should

also forward to Government not later than the first of the succeeding month

half yearly statements showing the particulars relating to each advance in

the prescribed form every year.

      (vii)  The following procedure should be observed for the disbursement of advances

for the purchase of house and house sites:—

347

          (1)   The details of the house and site or the site proposed to be bought and

the house to be built on it should be given in the application, as far as
possible.    The  approximate  value  of    the  land  and  building,  should

however be indicated in the application.  The value of the house proposed

to  be  purchased  or  constructed  should  cover  two-thirds  of  the  loan

amount applied for.

AFTER  COMPLETE  REPAYMENT  OF  THE  LOAN

AND  INTEREST

 244 F. 1. When a government servant who has taken an advance under the rules for

grant of house construction advance has remitted the principal and interest

thereon, he should makes a request for release of mortgages to the Head of

Department/Sanctioning authority concerned. When the loanee is a Head of

Department the request should be made to the  Secretary, Board of Revenue.

The Head of the Department/Sanctioning Authority/the Secretary, Board of

Revenue as the case may be, should forward the request to the Accountant

General for verification. The Accountant General will verify the loan amount

and recommend to the sanctioning authority whether the security documents

may be released. The sanctioning authority may then issue formal orders for

the release of securities.

                  The Head of Department/sanctioning authority shall then prepare a draft release

deed in Form 52 by an endorsement of the same on the mortgage deed itself. In

cases where the sanctioning authority is Government in the Finance Department,

it  should  then  be  forwarded  to  the  Finance  Secretary  for  execution.  The

sanctioning authority will execute the deed and return it to the loanee direct with

instructions  to  present  the  document  for  registration  before  the  concerned

registering office within four months from the date of execution. In cases where

the sanctioning authority is Government in the Finance Department, a copy of

the instructions will be sent to the Secretary, Board of Revenue or the Head of

Department as the case may be. The sanctioning authority will also simultaneously

351

inform the concerned Registering Officer to register the same and report details

of  registration  to  the  sanctioning  authority. The  date  of  execution  of  the
deed will be noted in the Register of Recoveries maintained by Heads of

Departments against the entry of the concerned Officer.

with effect from 1-4-1990. The advance may be sanctioned to pensionable
employees  of  Government  owned  industrial  concerns  and  to  Work
Establishment staff also. Full-time contingent employees are also eligible for

nature and that the applicant is likely to continue in service till the repayment
of the advance is completed.  Application for advances should be addressed
to the sanctioning authority (Form 40).

        (b)  The Heads of Department are competent to sanction advances for the purchase

officers, subject to the following general conditions and also subject to such
special conditions as may be fixed by them in this regard, the power to sanction
advance for the purchase of cycle in accordance with the rules and within the

         [ ART. 245

       (ii)    The power may be delegated only with the prior approval of the Government

in the  Finance Department.

                            General conditions under which the advance is sanctioned

    (c) (i)   No advance will be sanctioned to a Government servant unless the

sanctioning authority considers that the possession of a cycle would

increase his efficiency. As a general rule no advance will be sanctioned

to  any  Government  servant  unless  he  is  in  permanent  service.  The

sanctioning  authority  may,  however,  sanction  an  advance  to  an

officiating or temporary employee who has put in a minimum continuous

service of 3 (three) years and who is not likely, as far as can be foreseen,

at  the  time  of  sanctioning  the  loan,  to  be  ousted  from  service.  The

sanctioning  authority  can  reject  any  application  without  assigning

reasons therefor.

         (ii)   No second advance will be granted within three years of a previous

advance unless satisfactory evidence is produced by the Government

servant concerned to the effect that the conveyance purchased with

the  help  of  the  previous  advance  has  become  unserviceable.  The

sanctioning  authority  should  furnish  a  certificate  with  the  orders

sanctioning the advance that the advance sanctioned is either a first

advance or a second advance sanctioned after a period of three years of

the previous advance.

        (iii)  An advance shall not exceed †`1000 (Rupees One thousand only) or the
anticipated price of the †conveyance whichever is less. (This amendment will
353
be deemed to have come into force with effect from 1-4-1993).

        (iv)  The principal of the advance should be recovered in equal instalments by

compulsory deduction from the pay of the borrower beginning with the first

payment of a full month’s pay after the advance is drawn provided that

the borrower may repay two or more instalments at the same time. The
maximum number of monthly instalments in which the advance may be
permitted to be repaid will be twenty in the case of permanent and non-
permanent  Government  servants.  In  the  case  of  non-permanent
Government servants the number of instalments should  when necessary
be fixed with reference to all the circumstances at a suitable number lower
than the permissible maximum.

                      The whole amount of advance should be completely recovered within
the  period  originally  fixed  unless  the  sanctioning  authority  extends
the period. The amount of monthly instalments should not be changed
by reason of the borrower going on leave or his drawing subsistence
allowance. In special circumstances, the Head of the Department may
recommend that the Government should reduce the monthly instalments
in  a  particular  case  for  the  duration  of  the  period  during  which  the
borrower does not draw any pay.

354

         (v)      The recovery of the interest will begin with the pay of the month subsequent
to the month in which the repayment of the principal is completed. Interest
should  be  calculated  on  the  balance  outstanding  on  the  last  day  of  each
month. If the total amount of interest does not appreciably exceed the amount
fixed for the equal monthly instalments for recovery of the principal, it should
be  recovered  in  a  single  instalment;  otherwise  it  should  be  recovered  in
instalments not appreciably exceeding that amount.

         (vi)        The advance when sanctioned should be drawn within a period of 2 (two)

months from the date of sanction.

       (vii)      A Government servant who takes an advance should within one month
after drawing the advance furnish the Head of Office with a certificate
stating  the  particulars  of  the  conveyance  purchased  with  the  advance
and the cash receipts obtained for the amount actually paid.

        (viii)      Within one month after the purchases of the cycle, the loanee should also
furnish the Head of Office with the licence obtained/transferred in his
name in respect of the cycle purchased, for verification.

property  of  the  Government  until  the  advance  is  completely  repaid
(together with the interest due in it).

           (x)     Every recipient of an advance shall give (in Form 41) an undertaking written
in three rupees stamp paper, to the effect that the conveyance will not be
disposed of either by transfer or by sale until the whole amount of the advance
together with interest is repaid.

     (d)    Before sanctioning an advance the sanctioning authority should satisfy itself
that the grant of the advance does not involve any departure from the rules, and
that no recovery against previous advances is outstanding against the applicant.
A copy of the order sanctioning the advance should be communicated to the
Accountant General.

                 The Head of Office should furnish a certificate to the audit office that he
has  verified  the  voucher  for  the  purchase  of  the  cycle  and  the  excess
amount, if any, has been refunded furnishing particulars of such refund. A
copy of such certificate should be furnished to the sanctioning authority
also.

   #(e)    The detailed accounts in respect of the advance sanctioned to non-gazetted
Government Servants should be maintained by the Departmental Officers
responsible for disbursement and recovery of the advice.

     Note 2:— If  a Government servant holds a temporary post, or officiates in
a  post without a lien on a  permanent Post or  officiates in a higher post
but has lien on a permanent lower post only, his pay for the purpose of
this  rule will be his pay in the temporary post or his officiating pay, as
the case may be.

 (ii)         An advance on account of a transfer should invariably be recorded on

the Government servant’s last pay certificate.

           [See  also Rule 168 (d)  of Part V of the Kerala Treasury Code.]

364

 (iii)     The advance pay should be recovered from the Government servant’s
pay in three equal  monthly instalments, and the first instalment should
deducted from the first full month’s pay drawn after the transfer. The
first two instalments should be fixed in whole rupees, and the remaining
balance including any fraction of a rupee should be recovered as the
third  instalment.  The  advance  of  travelling  allowance  should  be
recovered in full in the Government servant’s travelling allowance bill
for the journey in question. The Government servant should present
this bill as soon as possible after the close of the month in which the
journey was performed, and if the amount of the bill is less than the
advance, he should refund the balance in cash at once. When recoveries
have  to  be  made  from  the  same  Government  servant  on  account  of
more than one advance of pay drawn on transfer, the recoveries should
be made concurrently. Any amount recovered from the Government
servant in excess of the advance drawn should, if it remains unclaimed
for one year from the date of the last recovery, be credited as revenue
to the Government.

 (iv)     If any member of a Government servant’s family does not accompany
him but follows him within six months from the date of his transfer a
separate advance may be granted at the time on account of the travelling

expenses of that member, provided that no advance has already been

drawn for the same purpose.

          When a single advance is drawn for the travelling expense of both the
Government servant, and his family, it may be adjusted by submitting

more than one bill, if the members of the Government servant’s family

do not actually complete the journey with him. The Government servant

should, however, certify on each adjustment bill that he will submit a

further bill in due course for the travelling allowance admissible on

account of the members of  his family (to be specified) who have not

yet completed the journey and that he expects the amount claimed in

that bill to be not less than the balance left unadjusted. If necessary he

should  refund  a  part  of  the  balance  in  cash  before  signing  this

certificate.

alive;

        (ii)  The amount of advance may be limited to ¾ of the probable amount of

T.A. admissible under Rule  99(2), Part II, K.S.R.

deceased Government servant on behalf of all. It should be the widow/

widower or any other member of the family (within the definition of term

sanctioning authority as to whom the advance may be given shall be

365

final.

       After the advance is sanctioned by the competent authority, it may be

drawn by the head of the office and paid to the member of the family

authorised in this behalf.

members of the deceased Government servant’s family travel in separate

batches from the same or different stations.

    (v)   The account of the advance drawn should be rendered within one

month of the completion of the journey, if the family travels in one

CHAPTER  X

DEPOSITS

Introductory

267.

In connection with the transaction of public business the Government receive
moneys deposited with them for various purposes by or on behalf of various
public bodies and members of the public, and afterwards account for them
by repayment or otherwise. Any department of the Government may receive
such deposits; a large number of them relate to the revenue administration or
the administration of justice. In relation to certain classes of deposits, e.g.,
Deposits of Local Funds, the Government’s function is merely that of a banker
; in connection with certain other classes, e.g.,  Civil Deposits, they also
control the administration of the money.

392

The Government sometimes decide to set aside sums from the revenues of a
year or a series of years to be accumulated as a ‘Fund’, the balance at the
credit  of  which  is  held  as  a  deposit  and  expended  on  specified  subjects.
They  also  receive  contributions  from  other  sources  to  some  such  funds
which they administer.

The  transactions  relating  to  money  of  the  kinds  described  above  are
accounted for in the “Deposit Section” of the Government accounts.

This Chapter deals with “Civil Deposits” which include the classes of deposits
closely connected with the administration of various Government departments
and controlled by the Government.

Classes of Civil Deposits

280.       Deposits of candidates standing for elections to the State Legislature and

Parliament and deposits on challenged votes received in connection therewith

General Principles and  Rules

281. (a) The treasury should not credit any amount under a deposit head without the

formal sanction of the competent authority. As a general rule, no amount

should be credited under a deposit head if it can be properly credited to

some other known head in the Government account. The Treasury or Sub-

Treasury  Officer  should  see  that  this  rule  is  strictly  followed  and  make
representations to the court or other authority ordering the acceptance of a

deposit,  if  he  considers  that  the  amount  should  be  credited  under  some

other head of account.

In  particular,  the  following  items  should  not  be  treated  as  deposits  but

should be credited, on receipt, to the departmental head of account most

nearly concerned, in accordance with the authorised procedure:—

       1.     Revenue paid to the Government on account of a demand not yet due.

       2.     Land revenue and cesses collected in one taluk on account of another.

       3.    Receipts for which full particulars are not available.

401

             Note:— These should be credited as miscellaneous receipts and adjusted

to the proper head subsequently, if necessary.

       4.      Any pay, pension or allowance or part thereof on the ground of the
absence of the payee or for any other reason except to the extent
indicated in items (13) and (28) of Article 269.

  [ ARTS.  281-282

      (b)  No transactions other than cash transactions may be accounted for in the
deposit section of the Government Account. Security deposits received from

contractors,  etc.,  in  forms  other  than  cash,  and  jewels  or  other  property

received for safe custody and return in kind should be brought on to the

special registers prescribed for the purpose. They should not be credited as

revenue or brought on to the deposit register, even though their value is

stated in money (See Article 287).

        (c)    No  money  tendered  as  Personal  Deposits  by  private  individuals  or  by

Government servants acting otherwise than in their official capacity and no

funds  of  quasi-public  institutions,  even  though  they  are  aided  by  the

Government,  may  be  accepted  for  deposit  in  a  treasury  except  under  an

order of the Government.

     (d)  The procedure to be followed by Government servants in paying moneys

received  as  deposits  into  the  treasury  or  the  bank  and  subsequently

withdrawing them, when necessary, for repayment to the depositors or other

persons entitled to them is prescribed in the Kerala Treasury Code.

Lapse of Deposits to the Government

282.       In certain circumstances deposits lapse to the Government and are credited

to  the  Government  under    the  appropriate  revenue  head  of  account.  The

following rules specify these circumstances :-

        1.       Revenue Deposits.— Deposits not exceeding five rupees unclaimed during

the whole of a financial year, balances not exceeding five rupees in each case

of  deposits  partly  repaid  during  the  year,  then  closing,  and  all  deposits

403

unclaimed for more than three complete financial years should be credited to

the Government at the close of March in each year. For the purpose of this
rule, the age of a deposit or the balance of a deposit not yet repaid should be

reckoned from the date of the original deposit and not from the date of the

last repayment.

           [ ARTS.  283-284

CHAPTER  XI

LOSSES OF PUBLIC MONEY  OR PROPERTY

         Securities and general principles for fixing and enforcing  responsibility

General

283.       The Government will hold a Government servant personally responsible for

any loss sustained by the Government through fraud or negligence on his

part, and also for any loss sustained through fraud or negligence on the part

of any other Government servant to the extent to which it may be shown that

he contributed to the loss by his own action or negligence (See also Article

8).

              The cardinal principle governing the assessment of responsibility for such

losses is that every Government servant should exercise the same diligence

and care in respect of all expenditure from public funds under his control as

a person of ordinary prudence would exercise in respect of the expenditure

of his own money (See also Article 40).

An officer’s honest errors of judgement involving financial loss may be

deserving of condonation if he can show that he has done his best upto the

limits of his ability and experience. Where, however, an officer is dishonest,

careless  or  negligent,  in  the  duties  entrusted  to  him,  and  causes  loss  to

Government,  the  case  is  clearly  one  for  punishment  and  enforcement  of

personal liability.

                  Rules to be observed in cashing bills or in remitting money from one
407

office to another

284.

A Government servant who has to arrange for public moneys to be carried

from  one  place  to  another  by  a  messenger  should  take  all  reasonable

precautions  to  prevent  any  loss  in  transit  due  to  misappropriation  of  the
moneys by the messenger or any other cause. He should pay due regard to
all relevant factors including the status of the messenger employed and the

distance over which the moneys have to be carried. As far as possible, he

should use for this purpose only permanent Government servants whom he

knows  to  be  reliable.  When  the  amount  to  be  carried  is  considerable,  he

should not entrust it to a single low-paid subordinate.

            The following rules should be observed in cashing bills or in remitting

money from one office to another.

        (1)        Generally only persons (peons, clerks, etc.) of proven reliability should be

engaged in the transmission of Government moneys.

408

      (2)       Peons may be permitted to carry amounts upto †  ` 50,000.

      (3)        Above †  ` 50,000 upto  `  1,00,000 one class III employee and a peon

may be engaged.

       (4)        If the amount is above  ` †1,00,000 one supervisory officer  and a peon

may be engaged.

Note 1:— Officers may use their discretion as to the persons to be employed

for the purpose. New recruits should not however be employed.

Note 2:— Special arrangements should be made whenever necessary for the
transmission of large amounts of cash involving  `  2,00,000 or more.
Officers  should  use  their  discretion  in  the  matter,  taking  into

consideration  the  kind  of  vehicle  engaged  and  the  distance  to  be

covered. If departmental vehicles are available they should be used for

the purpose. If police escort is considered necessary, it may be obtained

on  requisition to the police authorities concerned.

Note 3:— *If more than one person is engaged for encashment of bills with

reference to the above rules, the bill should be endorsed in favour of

the person belonging to the higher/highest grades among the persons

so engaged. The drawing officer may engage persons specified against
a higher monetary limit for encashment of bills falling with in a lower
monetary  limit.  They  may  engage  persons  falling  within  a  lower
monetary limit against a higher monetary limit, only when the sanctioned
strength of the members of the staff of the office does not permit him to
satisfy  the  above  rules.  In  such  cases,  the  necessity  of  such  an
endorsement should also be certified in the bill by the drawing officer.
The services of the Executive Officers may also be utilised in office
where there are no categories of employees mentioned in the previous
sub-paragraph.

      Note 4:— @The above provision do not apply to remitting of cash and
other valuables to and from the Treasuries which are always to be with
police escort and for which the provisions of the rules in Part VI of
Kerala Treasury Code Vol. I shall apply. However, the above provisions
should be observed by the Treasury Officers for the drawal of imprests
from the Bank and the remittance of imprest balance into the Bank, if
no police escort is provided for such withdrawals and remittances.

285.       One important method by which the Government endeavour to minimise the
risk of losses and ensure that it shall be possible to recover the amount of
any loss that may be sustained is (1)  by taking of adequate Fidelity Insurance
covers in respect of posts to which the custody or handling of Government
cash or stores is assigned and  (2)by taking adequate security from contractors
who supply stores or executive works for the Government.

code or manual concerned and the relevant special orders of Government, if

any. Where no definite orders or rules already exist Government servants in

charge of offices will be responsible for reporting to their superior officers,

and the latter to Government, as to the necessity or otherwise for security

being taken in any particular case and the Government will determine the

amount of the security to be obtained with due regard to the circumstances

of each case.

The amount should be fixed at a sum equal to the maximum amount which

the holder of the post ordinarily has in his hands at any one time. The Head

410

of  the  Office  should  see  that  the  amount  of  cash  or  valuables  left  in  the

hands of the Government Servant holding such post is not more than the

amount fixed for that particular post to be covered by Fidelity Insurance.

All Heads of  Departments will forward to the State Insurance Officer, the

details of the posts for which Fidelity Insurance covers are necessary, the

amounts of the policies etc. On receipt of such details the State Insurance

Officer will issue policies in each case. The premium on such policies will be

paid by the respective departments from their contingencies. The Head of

the Department will see that the insurance policies are kept alive.

           * Collective Fidelity Guarantee Insurance Policies will be issued covering all

the employees in security posts in a department, if there are more than one

such post in a department. In such cases the names of the employees, the

names of the posts, the sum guaranteed for each post and the number of

such posts in the department will be shown in the policy. Such policies will

be for a period of 12 months and renewed from time to time.

A register for watch the timely remittance of premium towards the Fidelity

policies taken collectively will be maintained in Form 43 (K.F.C Vol.II) by each

department.

                    [ ART. 287-288

Security Deposits—Contractors

287.         Whenever a private person or firm contracts with the Government to supply
stores or execute a work, he or it should, unless exempted by a competent
authority, be required to give security for the due fulfilment of the contract
and suitable provisions regarding the security should be incorporated in the
agreement executed with reference to Article 140  (ii)  and 181 a reference to
the agreement should be recorded in the Register of Security Deposits. This
Register should be in Form 43 except when some other form is specially
prescribed in the rules or orders applicable to any department.

In all contracts entered into on the part of Government under which sums of
money are payable by contractors, adequate security should be taken for
sums being paid as they fall due. Where the circumstances are such that
security cannot conveniently be furnished the contractors should be required
to pay the sums due on the contract quarterly in advance; and the instalments
on  account  of  each  quarter  should  be  paid  at  least  a  month  before  the
beginning  of  the  quarter  for  which  the  advance  payment  is  required.  In
default  the  contract  should  at  once  be  cancelled  and  new  arrangements
made so that as far as possible Government may be protected from loss.

These orders apply not only to Government leases and contracts,  but also
to similar engagements on the part of local bodies, in cases which are not
specifically provided for in the departmental rules. What has to be specially
guarded against is the overlooking of the demand outstanding on account
of contracts till the end of the year for which they are current, by which time
heavy balances are liable to accrue and it may become impossible to effect
full recovery and secure necessary adjustment.

411

          Form of  Security and Conditions on which they are accepted

288.        The Security taken from a contractor should be in one of the following forms
subject to the conditions noted against each, or partly in one and partly in
another of these forms when this is specially permitted by the departmental
authority authorised to accept the security.

Security in any such form should be
accepted in the particular department
concerned only in accordance with the

rules and conditions laid down in the

relevant  Departmental  Code  or

Manual  or  in  special  orders  of  the

Government.

The  Security  coverage  will  be

confined  only  to  the  actual  amount

initially invested by the depositor, as

indicated in the Bhadratha certificate.

Note 1:— When a work is executed on the piece-work contract system, security may

writing, as otherwise it requires to be renewed, that the transfer endorsements

made thereon are in proper order, and that there is no reason to question the

signature of the endorser. Ordinarily if the signature is in English, it should

agree letter for letter with the endorser’s name as spelt in the transferring

endorsement. He should also see that the chain of the endorsements on the

Note is complete, that is, that the persons or officers who endorse the Note

away are the same as those in whose name it already stood or to whom it has
been  endorsed. An  endorsement  signed  “for”    any  other  person  is  invalid
unless it is supported by a Power of Attorney.

             If there is any doubt about the regularity of endorsements, the depositor may be

required to have the Note renewed in his own name.

             Endorsements to or by any person “in trust for” any other, or as ‘trustee
of’  anything  are  also  invalid.  All  words  relating  to  the  trust  must  be
expunged  under  the  initials  or  signature  of  the  person  in  whose
endorsement  they  occur.  Endorsements  written  upon  a  piece  of  paper
attached to a Note are also invalid.

            If all the transfer columns on the reverse of a Note are used up, the Note should
not be accepted as it would not be possible to re-transfer the same in favour of the
depositors when the security is released. The endorsement should be unconditional.

289.       Security furnished in cash by a contractor may be converted at the cost of the
depositor, into one (or when specially permitted, partly into one and partly into
another) or the interest bearing forms of security mentioned in items (2) to (9) in
the preceding article, provided—

419

     (i)       that the depositor has expressly requested in writing that this be done;

and

        (ii)   that the acceptance of the new form or forms of security is permissible
under the rules and under the terms of the agreement of bond.

               Cash actually received or recovered may be converted into an interest bearing
form of security in the manner described above, even when it forms part of a
deposit which is being paid in instalments and has not yet been realised in full.
Percentage deductions made from a contractor’s bill held as security for the due
fulfilment of a contract should not, however, be converted into any other forms

of security unless a departmental rule or order makes special provision for such

conversion.

Post Office Savings Bank Deposits

290.        The following procedure should be observed when cash tendered as security

420

is to be deposited in the Post Office Savings Bank:—

      (i)   The Government servant who takes the security (the pledge) should

send a letter to the Postmaster through the person who has to furnish

the  security  explaining  the  nature  of  the  security  and  requiring  the

Postmaster to receive the deposit and issue the pass book in his (the

pledgee’s)  name  “On  account  of  the  security  of A.B.  (the  person

pledging)”. The person who is to furnish the security should present

the letter at the Post Office with the requisite amount in cash and savings

Bank index card in the prescribed form signed at the foot by the pledgee.

     (ii)    The Postmaster will deliver the Savings Bank pass book to the person

pledging the security. The latter should transmit it without delay to the

pledgee, and the pledgee should give him a receipt for it in the prescribed

form.

Registration of Security Bonds

291.       The registration of a security bond is compulsory if security is furnished in

the form of immovable property. When security is furnished in any other

form, registration of the security bond is optional and it need not be registered

unless in any particular case the Head of the Department considers that the

Government interest would be prejudiced by not registering it. In all cases

420

CHAPTER XI ] LOSSES OF PUBLIC MONEYS OR PROPERTY         [ ARTS.  291-292

where registration is considered necessary, it should be done at the expense
of the Government.

Custody of Securities and Security Bonds

292.     Treasury  and  post  office  savings  bank  pass  books,  fidelity  bonds  and

security bonds or agreement should be kept in the safe custody of the

departmental authority which takes the security.

All the treasury and post office saving bank  pass books should be sent to

the Treasury and Post Office respectively as soon as possible after the 15th

June of each year, so that the necessary entries on account of interest may

be made in them.

                  Government Promissory Notes, Stock Certificates, National Savings Certificates,

National Plans Savings Certificates and Treasury Savings Certificates, Municipal

Debentures and Port Trust Bonds deposited as security should be lodged for

safe custody with the District Treasuries. The Government officer who receives

the Notes, etc., will, after entering them in a register in Form 45, forward them in

registered  cover  to  the  District Treasury  Officer. With  each  despatch  of  the
Notes, etc., a covering list in duplicate in Form 46 should be sent, one copy of

which will be signed and returned to the Government Officer who forwarded the

Notes, etc.

  Note:— A receipt should invariably be furnished to the depositor when the

Notes, etc., are received and brought on this register. The receipt may

be in the same form as the register but with the first four columns only.

The receipt should be surrendered by the depositor when the Notes

421

etc., are returned to him. The return of the Notes, etc., should at once

be noted in the register which should be kept in the personal custody
of the departmental authority who accepts the security.

                A  departmental authority which accepts a deposit receipt of a bank mentioned

in item (9) of Article 288 as security should retain the receipts in its safe custody.

421

 CHAPTER XI ]

  [ ARTS.  292-294

The depositor should receive the interest, when due direct from the bank on a

letter from the pledgee authorising the bank to pay it to him.

Periodical Verification of all Securities

293.        Every departmental authority should verify periodically, and at least once a

year in May all securities which it has taken in various forms in respect of

certain posts and from contractors and report the result to the immediate

superior authority.

               This rule applies to all forms of security, including personal security or security

422

in the form of immovable property. In verifying personal security, a departmental

authority should satisfy itself as the solvency of the surety, and in verifying

security in the form of immovable property, it should see that the actual market

value of the property is not  less than the amount  of security required.

               The articles deposited in the Treasuries for safe custody should be verified

at least once a year by the  Officer who deposited them. For this purpose the

articles deposited in Treasuries should be taken back, their contents verified

and re-deposited (if necessary) once in a year. Verification should also be
made whenever there is a change of incumbent or change of designation or

change  of  jurisdiction  of  the  Officer  who  deposited  the  articles  for  safe

custody.

         Annual Valuation of  Government Promissory Notes, etc.

294.      When a contractor has furnished any security in the form of Government

Promissory Notes or Government Stock Certificates or Municipal Debentures

of Port Trust Bonds, the departmental authority which received the securities

and sent them for safe custody should ascertain in May of each year whether
their value, who valued at the market price of May 1st of that year or the face

value whichever is less in each case, is still sufficient to cover the amount of

security required. If the total value of the securities deposited by a contractor,

as ascertained at this annual valuation, falls short of the amount of security

422

  CHAPTER XI ] LOSSES OF PUBLIC MONEYS OR PROPERTY [ ARTS.  294-295

required plus 5 per cent by  ` 100 or more, the departmental authority should
at once call on the depositor to furnish additional security to the extent of

shortage.  No securities should be returned to any depositor on account of

an increase in their value as ascertained at this annual valuation unless (i)

the securities have appreciated so considerably that securities of the face
value of  ` 100 or more could be withdrawn and the remaining securities
(valued as prescribed above) would still be sufficient to cover the amount of

security required  plus 5 per cent to provide against fluctuations, and (ii)  the

depositor submits a written request for the return of the securities that could

be so withdrawn.

295.(a)    Repayment  of  Security  Deposits.—  Without  the  special  orders  of  the

competent authority, no security deposit should be repaid or re-transferred

to the depositor or otherwise disposed of, except in accordance with the

terms  of  his  security  bond  or  agreement. A  departmental  authority  on

returning  any  security  to  a  depositor  should  invariably  obtain  his

acknowledgement  duly  signed  and  witnessed.  When  an  interest  bearing

security is returned or retransferred, the acknowledgement should set-forth
the full particulars of the security.

               The percentage deduction from bills which are held as additional security,

will be released by the officer competent to pass the final bill at his discretion,

after the successful completion of the work, retaining only such amounts as

he may consider necessary to cover the liabilities, if any, of the contractor.

       (b)   Repayment of cash deposited in the Post Office Savings Bank.— When an
423

amount lodged in the Post Office Savings Bank as a security deposit under

Article 288 is no longer required, the departmental authority to which it is

pledged (pledgee) should obtain from the person who pledged the security

the receipt originally granted to him for the pass book or a fresh receipt duly

signed and witnessed. Such receipts should be duly numbered and filed,

and the numbers should be entered in the Register of Security Deposits.

CHAPTER XI ]

            [ ART.  295

After obtaining a proper receipt, the pledgee should deliver the Post Office

Savings Bank pass book to the person who pledged the security and furnish

him with an application in the form prescribed by the Postal Department for

the withdrawal of the balance at the credit of the account together with the

interest  due  on  it.  The  pledgee  should  sign  the  application  and  enter  the

name of person who pledged the security as that of the messenger or agent

entitled to receive payment.  The person who pledged the security will then

be able to withdraw the amount due to him from the Post Office Savings

Bank.

424

        (c)   Adjustment of a claim against a Security Deposit lodged in the Post Office

Savings Bank.— When the pledgee has a claim on behalf of the Government

against a security deposit account pledged to him in the Post Office Savings

Bank [in accordance with Rule 45(f) or (g)  of the Post Office Savings Bank

Rules] at a Post Office which has direct transactions with the treasury and

the amount of the claim is to be credited to the Government, he should send

the pass book to the Post Office with the usual application for withdrawal

duly signed by him and with the words “To be adjusted by transfer in the
Government accounts to the credit of the.................. Department (State)”

written in red ink across it. The Post Office will make the necessary entries in

the  pass  book  and  send  the  pledgee  a  treasury  voucher  for  the  amount

withdrawn. When the pledgee has more than one security deposit account

pledged to him at the Post Office Savings Bank and applies for the withdrawal

of  moneys  from  more  than  one  such  account  on    the  same  day,  the  Post

Office will issue only a single treasury voucher covering all the withdrawals.

If the pledgee does not receive the treasury voucher by the  next day after

that on which he sends the application, he should call for it from the Post
Office. On receipt of the treasury voucher, the departmental authority  which

applied for the withdrawal should verify the entries, countersign it and forward

it to the Treasury or Sub-treasury Officer as soon as possible in accordance

424

CHAPTER XI ] LOSSES OF PUBLIC MONEYS OR PROPERTY   [ ARTS.  295-296

with  the  procedure  prescribed  in  this  connection  in  the  Kerala  Treasury
Code (See Rule 110 of the Kerala Treasury Code).

              If the Post Office at which the security deposit account in the Post Office

Savings Bank has been opened has no direct transactions with the Treasury,

the pledgee should apply to the Post Office for the withdrawal of the amount
required in the ordinary manner and on receipt of the amount should remit it
into the treasury like any other departmental receipt.

                When, after a transfer or payment, a pass book shows any balance in favour of
the depositor the Postmaster will return it to the pledgee. When the account is
closed by a transfer or payment, the Postmaster will not return the pass book to
the pledgee, but will deal with it in accordance with the Post Office Savings Bank
Rules.

Note  1:—  Government  officers  should  see,  before  releasing  or  returning
securities,  that  all  claims  of  Government  against  the  depositor  are
completely satisfied. It is not advisable to keep securities for a longer
period  than  is  absolutely  necessary;  all  claims  should  as  a  rule  be
settled within one year from the expiry of the period of deposit. Release
notices should be issued as soon as the liabilities of depositors are
settled even if the security accounts are at that time under attachment
by civil courts.

Note 2:— Where the security consists of the title deeds of immovable property
and the bond has been registered, a reconveyance of the property may
be executed at the end of one year and registered in due course.

                              Security Deposit of a Private Employer of a Government

425

Servant on Foreign Service

296.      When a Government servant is to be transferred to foreign service under a
private employer, the  Government may require the employer to deposit
before the transfer is sanctioned, security equivalent to three months’ pay
of the Government servant in foreign service. The security should consist
of either.

form of promissory Notes or Stock Certificates endorsed or transferred
in favour of the Government, or

      (iii)       A Treasury Savings Bank Deposit, the pass book for which is deposited

with and pledged to the head of the office of the Government servant

concerned.

A Treasury Savings Bank pass book so pledged should be kept, in the safe

426

custody of the authority to which it is pledged; securities of the Central or

the State Governments in the forms of Promissory Notes and  Stock Certificates

should be lodged for safe custody with the District Treasury. The security

deposit should be returned to the private employer after the Government

servant’s period of foreign service expires and the claims of the Government
and  the Government servant against the private employer have been settled.

  Note:— The term “Private employer” used in this Article will not include within its

scope  the  Central  Government,  other  State  Government,  Municipalities,

Universities and other Local Bodies, in the State.

Government  servant  subordinate  to  him  is  involved,  he  should  send  a
preliminary report immediately to the Accountant General and through the

proper  channel,  to  the  Head  of  the  Department.  The  Head  of  the  Office

should  simultaneously  take  necessary  action  to  ensure  the  safety  of  the

relevant documents. On receipt of the information the Head of the Department

should report the matter to the Government without delay. These reports

should  be  sent  even  when  the  person  responsible  for  a  loss  has  made  it

good. Reports regarding a loss by way or damage to immovable property

belonging to the Government should be sent in accordance with the special

provisions of Article 302.

               The preliminary report to the Accountant General  may be either a copy of

the report to the Head of the Department or relevant extracts from it showing,

so far as information is available at the time, the exact nature of the defalcation

or loss and the circumstances which made it possible.

                After sending the preliminary reports, the Head of the Office should investigate

the matter fully without delay and take all necessary further action—See Article

303 and 305. As soon as the investigation is complete, he should send a complete

and  detailed  final  report  to  the Accountant  General  and  through  the  proper

channel, to the Head of the Department, describing the nature and extent of the

loss  or  account  irregularity  and  the  circumstances  (including  any  breach  or

neglect of an existing rule) which made it possible, and stating whether any

amount lost has been recovered and, if not whether it is possible to recover it in

any way. The report should also state what disciplinary action has been taken,

or  is  recommended,  against  the  Government  servants  responsible  and  what

427

steps have been taken, or are recommended  with a view to prevent the recurrence

of any such loss or account irregularity. The Head of the Department should
submit a final report to the Government giving full information on all these

points and, when necessary, making his recommendations.

                    When  a  petty  loss  not  exceeding  `  300  does  not  appear  to  involve  an
embezzlement, a serious account irregularity or any other important feature
requiring detailed investigation and consideration, or concern the Reserve
Bank, the preliminary and final reports prescribed in this Article need only be
sent to the authority competent to write off the loss or deal with it otherwise.

   Note :— Any loss in respect of stores occurring otherwise than in the ordinary
course or an accounts of fair wear and tear should be treated as a loss
to the Government within the meaning of this Article— See also Article
155 and 301.

         Losses with which the Reserve Bank, etc., are concerned

428

298.       If the Accountant General becomes aware, in any manner of any loss to the
Government which the Reserve Bank of India may possibly be held to be
liable  to  make  good  the  Government  whether  it  relates  to  operations
conducted by the Reserve Bank or its agents on Government account or to
any other matter, he will immediately call for such further information as he
may require regarding it. On receipt of this further information, which must
be  obtained  without  delay,  he  will,  at  once  make  a  full  report  to  the
Government. If there is any doubt or dispute as to the facts of the liability, the
Government will arrange with the authorities concerned for a Government
Servant and an officer of the Reserve Bank (and an officer of the State Bank
of India if the loss relates to an operation effected through its agency) to be
appointed as soon as possible to carry out a joint investigation of the facts,
while  they  are  fresh,  and  make  a  full  report  together  with,  if  possible  a
recommendation for an amicable settlement. If they are unable to make any
such joint recommendation, their report should at least clear the ground as
far  as  possible,  so  that  a  stated  case  may  be  referred,  if  necessary,  to  an
arbitrator or a legal authority. This investigation will be under taken at once
and independently of any departmental or police enquiry.

             Losses of Cash due to acceptance of Counterfeit Coins

299.       Losses of cash due to acceptance of counterfeit coins in State treasuries
should  not  be  debited  to  Government  in  any  case  without  their  specific
approval.

Write off Losses

300.     † Write off is the relinquishment of claims after exhausting all possible means
of  recovery.  Irrecoverable  losses  of  stores  and  removal  of  the  value  of
obsolete  stores  and  stock  from  the  accounts  are  also  finally  disposed  of
through write off (See Articles 81 and 82 of the Kerala Account Code Vol.I).
The power to write off irrecoverable value of stores delegated to certain
Heads of   Departments is subject to the condition that the loss does not
disclose a defect of system, the amendment of which requires the orders of
Government. The order of the competent authority should also be obtained
for  writing  off  from  any  relevant  value  of  commercial  accounts  that  are
maintained, any irrecoverable amount relating to a loss connected with a
building,  land  or  equipment  or  to  unprofitable  outlay  on  a  work.  The
Government  have  empowered  the  authorities  mentioned  in  the  Book  of
Financial  Powers  to  sanction  such  writes  off  subject  to  the  limits  and
conditions mentioned therein.

              † Every Head of  Department should submit annually on or before the first of
June to the Accountant General, a statement showing all the amounts written
off  which  were  sanctioned  by  himself  or  any  other  competent  authority
under his control during the preceding financial year. The statement  should
show the total amount written off under each class and should include a
brief explanation of the circumstances leading, to the write off].

    Note:—  In  general  losses  sustained  by  the  Central  Government  in  State
treasuries through the negligence or culpability of the staff paid for by
a Government in any State and vice  versa should be borne as they
occur i.e. by the Central Government if  the loss occurs, in connection
with Central transactions and,  by the State Government,  if it is on
account of  State Transactions.

429

recovered  should  be  credited  to  the  Government  which  under  the  above

arrangement would bear the loss for this purpose. Recoveries made indirectly,

e.g., by stoppage of increment or promotion as a measure of punishment,

should not be treated as recoveries made in cash. Where the staff is paid for

by one Government and the loss is borne by another Government a copy of

the orders regarding the action taken against the persons responsible for the

loss should be communicated by the former to the latter.

and the formal sanction of the competent authority should be obtained for

writing  them  off  or  dealing  with  them  otherwise,  even  when  no  formal

correction  or  adjustment  in  the  accounts  is  necessary.  Losses  due  to

depreciation should be analysed and recorded under the following heads,

according as they are due to:—

         (1)      normal fluctuation of market prices;

         (2)      fair wear and tear ;

                   (3)      lack of foresight in regulating purchases, or

         (4)      neglect after purchase.

                Losses not due to depreciation should be grouped and recorded under the

following heads:—

         (1)      losses due to theft ;

         (2)      losses due to neglect, and

         (3)      losses due to calamities such as fire or flood.

            The provisions of Article 297 apply to all losses mentioned in this Article
except items (1)  and  (2)  under losses due to depreciation. The rules regarding
the disposal of obsolete, surplus and unserviceable stores are contained in
Articles 153 to 157.

  Note:– When a contractor or a departmental employee fails to return any
Government  tools,  their  value,  including  the  appropriate  centage

Damage to Immovable Government Property

302.         When a loss occurs by way of damage to any immovable property belonging
to  the  Government  (including  buildings,  communications  and  irrigation
works) due to any calamity such as fire or flood or to any cause other than
fair wear and tear, the Government servant in  immediate charge of the property
should report the matter at once to his immediate superior and a preliminary
report should be sent through the proper channel without delay to the Head
of the Department, who will report  the loss to the Government. When the
cause of the loss has been fully investigated and it has been decided whether
or not the property should be restored, the Head of the Office concerned
should send a final detailed report to the Head of the Department and at the
same time an abstract of it in Form 47 to Accountant General. The Head of
the Department should send a final detailed report to the Government when
he  proposes  that  the  Government  should  write  off  the  loss,  recommends
that the Government should take disciplinary action or applies for funds to
be specially provided to meet the cost of restoration of the property.

When a petty loss not exceeding  `  300 does not appear to involve any
important  feature  requiring  detailed  investigation  and  consideration,  the
preliminary and final reports prescribed in this Article need only be sent to
the authority competent to write off the loss or deal with it otherwise.

In cases of loss by way of damage to any immovable property belonging to

431

the Government, the value of the damaged portion need not be written off

the accounts, if the restoration of the damaged portion is commenced within
the period of two years from the date of damage.

All river conservancy works are treated as repair works and consequently

losses by way of  damage to such works will not reduce the capital value of

any  Government  property  and  so  need  not  be    formally  written  off    the

accounts. The preliminary and final reports prescribed in this Article should,
however, be sent in respect of any such loss when it exceeds  ` 1000. Any
such  loss  not  exceeding    `  1000  need  only  be  reported  to  the  authority
competent to sanction the restoration of the damaged work.

                  General Principles and Procedure for Fixing and Enforcing

Responsibility for Losses

303A.     The following general principles should be followed in enforcing the personal

432

responsibility of the Government servant or servants concerned for a loss

sustained by the Government through fraud or negligence on his part or on

the part of any other Government servant to the extent be contributed to the

loss by his own action or negligence and of any person for a loss sustained

by the Government on account of a criminal offence committed by him:—

        (1)    Whenever there is reason to suspect that the Government have sustained

a loss on account of fraud or any other criminal offence on the part of

any person or negligence (which includes a financial irregularity) on the

part  of  any  Government  servant,  the  Head  of  the  office  or  other

appropriate administrative authority should investigate the matter full

without avoidable delay. In order to avoid the relevant documents being

tampered with by the time an enquiry is instituted, the Head of the Office,

should take immediate steps to  ensure the safety, of those documents.

When  necessary, the administrative authority may ask the Accountant

General to furnish all vouchers and other documents in his possession

that may be relevant to the investigation. If the investigation is so complex

as to require the assistance of an expert audit officer, the administrative

authority should report  the facts to the Government and request them to

obtain the services of an audit officer  to assist in the investigation.  If

the Government depute an audit officer for the purpose, the administrative

432

CHAPTER XI ]     LOSSES OF PUBLIC MONEYS OR PROPERTY      [ ART.  300A

authority and the audit officer will be personally responsible, within
their respective spheres, for completing the investigation expeditiously.

     (2)         Whenever it appears likely that recourse may be had to judicial proceedings

in connection with a loss sustained by the Government, the administrative

authority should take competent legal advice at once.   If there is a reasonable

suspicion that a loss sustained by the Government is due to the commission

of a criminal offence, the procedure prescribed in Articles 304 and 305 should

be followed.

       ( 3)  (a)    Whenever an administrative authority holds that a Government servant  is

responsible for a loss sustained by the Government,  it should always

consider  both  whether  the  whole  or  any  part  of  the  loss  should  be

recovered from him in money and whether any other  form of  disciplinary

action should be taken.   In deciding the amount to be recovered,  it

should  consider    not  only  the  circumstances  of  the  loss  but  also    the

Government  servant’s financial  position,  since the penalty should not

be such as to impair his future efficiency.

              (b)    Whenever a loss is held to be due to fraud on the part of a Government

servant or servants,  every endeavour  should be made to  recover  the

whole amount  lost from the guilty persons.   If the failure of a superior

officer to exercise proper supervision and control has facilitated the fraud,

he  should  be  called  strictly  to  account  and  suitably  dealt  with  after

carefully assessing  his personal responsibility in the matter,  e.g.,  by

recovering from him in money a suitable proportion  of the loss, or by

stopping his increments or reducing the pay.

433

            (c)   Whenever any Government property or equipment  is lost, damaged or

destroyed on account of the  carelessness of a Government  servant to

whom it is entrusted (e.g., a police-man’s rifle, a factory motor, lorry or an

Engineer’s  instruments),  the  appropriate  administrative  authority

should always consider whether the amount of the loss sustained by

433

                                      THE  KERALA  FINANCIAL CODE  VOL  I
 CHAPTER XI ]

            [ ART.  303A

the Government  should not be recovered in full up to the limit of the

Government servant’s capacity to pay.

Note:—  Interest  at  !  18  per  cent  per  annum  or  at  such  rate  as  fixed  by

Government  from time to time should be charged   after the liabilities

are determined and from the time a written demand is made, on the

amount  of  liability  fixed  against    delinquent    officers  involved  in

defalcation cases,  the interest  so charged  being not lower than !15 per

cent per annum in any event.

        (4)  (a)     In cases where a competent authority holds that a Government  servant  is

434

responsible for a loss sustained by the Government  and orders that any

amount should be recovered from him and he is about  to retire from

service, the amount should be recovered as far as possible by deduction

from the last pay and allowances  or leave salary due to him.  If the amount

due to Government  exceeds the amount payable  to the Government

servant, the excess shall be recovered from his claim  for death-cum-
retirement-gratuity after giving the officer a reasonable opportunity to
explain.  If the amount  proposed to be recovered  exceeds the  death-cum-
retirement-gratuity,  the excess  over  death-cum-retirement-gratuity can
be recovered from the arrears of pension, if any,  due to the officer if
written consent is obtained from him as pension (as  distinct from death-
cum-retirement-gratuity) enjoys the protection of the ‘Pension Act’.  A
written consent is valid only to the extent it covers the amount of pension
earned by him till the date of such written consent.

                (b)    If, however,  the liabilities could not be finalised but could be estimated at
the time of retirement,  either the estimated amount of the outstanding
dues  plus  25  per  cent    thereof  should  be  withheld  from  death-cum-
retirement-gratuity or a surety bond or cash deposit not exceeding the
estimated amount of the outstanding dues plus 25 per cent  thereof should
be accepted before  releasing pension and death-cum-retirement  gratuity

! Addition C.S.No.03/2013 [G.O.(P) No. 565/2013 /Fin., Dated  18/11/2013]

434

   CHAPTER XI ] LOSSES OF PUBLIC MONEYS OR PROPERTY              [ ART. 303A

                (c)    If disciplinary proceedings are being continued against an officer under
the Service Rules on the date of retirement,  only a provisional pension
should be sanctioned to him withholding however,  the entire death-cum-
retirement-gratuity due to him.

               (d)    In cases where the liabilities  could not be estimated the pension and
death-cum-retirement-gratuity  will  be  released    provisionally  after
withholding from the death-cum-retirement gratuity the amount noted
below:

 (1)  Officers in charge of cash or stores The full amount of death-cum-retirement

gratuity.

(2)   Gazetted Officers other than those

          in (1) above

10 per cent of the death-cum-retirement
gratuity or ` 2,000 whichever is higher.

(3)   Non-Gazetted Officers other than
         (1)

 10 per cent of the death-cum- retirement
gratuity or ` 600 whichever is higher.

         In all cases where the liabilities could not be assessed and fixed before

retirement of the Government servants, efforts should be made to assess

and adjust the recoverable dues within a period of one year from the date

of retirement of the Government servant concerned. If in any case, the

liability could not be assessed and adjusted within one year, the amount

withheld from the death-cum-retirement gratuity or the surety bond or

cash deposit accepted under paragraph (c) or  (d) above will be released.

Disciplinary action shall be taken against the officers responsible for the

failure to assess and adjust the liabilities within the prescribed period.

435

             (e)    If in any case the amount withheld from the death-cum-retirement

gratuity  or  the  cash  deposit,  or  the  surety  bond  taken  from  the

officer is not adequate to cover the liabilities finally fixed, action

should be taken against him under the Service Rules to make up

the loss by withholding, withdrawing or effecting recoveries from

435

                                      THE  KERALA  FINANCIAL CODE  VOL  I
 CHAPTER XI ]

             [ART.  303B

the  pensions  sanctioned.  If  action  under  the  Service  Rules  is  not

possible due to the expiry of the time limit prescribed for such action

or due to any other reason, the retired officer will be proceeded against

through  a  Civil  Court  for  recovering  the  pecuniary  loss  caused  to

Government.

               (f)    When a retired Government servant whose pension has already been

sanctioned is held to have caused a loss to the Government by fraud

or negligence while in service and it appears likely that the amount

could be recovered by bringing a suit against him, the matter should

436

be reported to the Government for orders. If in any particular case, it is

not found feasible to take action against a retired Government servant

in regard to a loss sustained by the Government on account of any

fraud or negligence found to have been committed by him while in

service, this should not be made an excuse for absolving any other

Government servants who are also responsible for the loss and are

still in service. Similarly, the fact that it is not possible to fix responsibility

on the officials who initiated or acquiesced in the initiation of any
irregularity resulting in loss to Government will not exonerate those

who subsequently acquiesced in the continuation of the irregularity.

It is the duty of  all Government officials to look after the financial

interests  of  Government  and  Government  will  hold  their  officers

responsible for such irregularities, not only those who originated them

but also those who subsequently permitted their continuance.

303B.   The following general principles should be followed in fixing monetary liabilities

so far as the Government servants are concerned :

         (i)   It should be carefully noted that personal monetary liability would arise

only when pecuniary loss is sustained by Government.   Irregularities in

the maintenance of accounts or in the sanction of expenditure would not

involve  monetary  liability  as  long  as  no  loss  to  Government  is  caused.

436

CHAPTER XI ]    LOSSES OF PUBLIC MONEYS OR PROPERTY    [ ART.  303B

Distinction  should  be  drawn  between  objections  involving  loss  to
Government  and  other  objections  in  an  audit  report.  The  latter  will  not

constitute monetary liability and will call for other forms of disciplinary action

wherever justified.

          (ii)   For the purpose of fixing liability, losses may be grouped under the following

categories:—

         (a)     Personal dues e.g., excess pay and allowance drawn, arrears of house

rent  payable,  balance  of  advances  repayable  such  as  Motor  Car

Advance, House Building Advance, Mosquito Net Advance, etc.

        (b)     Physical loss of cash or stores.

         (c)    Loss or extra expenditure arising out of administrative lapses e.g.,

payment of demurrage charges, payment of surcharge (Final) on

electricity  bills  and  Radio  Licence  fees,  expenditure  incurred  in

excess  of  one’s  powers  not  ratified  by  the  competent  authority,

purchases effected in violation of Stores Purchase Rules resulting

in extra expenditure, printing charges to private firms in excess of
approved rates, sanctioning posts in schools  in excess of the limits

prescribed, irregular grant of fee concessions, stipends, etc., loss

of revenue due to wrong assessment of claims becoming time-barred,

etc.

       Recovery in cash is called for in respect of categories (a) and (b). In

regard to category (c), cash recovery should ordinarily arise only if

mala fides are proved. The term “malafides” may be defined in this

437

context as a state of mind where the Officer may be deemed to have

acted with the intention to be benefited directly or indirectly by such
action.  In  other  cases  falling  under  category  (c),  it  should  be  seen

whether the types of irregularities previously pointed out have been

repeated. If the irregularities have been repeated or are of a serious

nature or magnitude, the question of taking other forms of disciplinary

437

                                      THE  KERALA  FINANCIAL CODE  VOL  I
CHAPTER XI ]

                    [ ARTS. 303A-304

action if the officer concerned is still in service or of reducing pension

under the Service Rules if already retired, should be considered.

         (iii)  In  cases  of  loss/infructuous  expenditure,  where  more  than  one  person  is

involved e.g., in the case of loss of  stores, apart from the direct responsibility

of the store-keeper the question of responsibility of the supervising officer/

officers having control over stores will also arise. In such cases the degree/

extent of personal responsibility of each individual should first be fixed strictly

with reference to his duties and responsibilities and the extent to which he

neglected  them.  The  fact  that  a  Government  servant  has  been  misled  or

438

deceived by a subordinate will, in no way mitigate his personal responsibility

since every government servant should be familiar with the financial rules

laid down by the Government and exercise a specially strict and close  control

over his subordinates in regard to the use of Public Funds and the maintenance

of  proper  accounts.  Having  fixed  the  personal  responsibility  of  each

individual in the above manner, cash recovery/other forms of disciplinary

action should be ordered with reference to such responsibility. In ordering

cash recovery, the Government servant’s financial position should also be
taken  into  consideration.  In  cases  where  it  is  not  possible  to  recover  the

share so fixed from one or more individuals due to their death or for other

reasons  the  question  may  be  taken  up  for  obtaining  sanction  from  the

competent  authority  for  the  loss  to  be  written  off.  It  should  however,  be

ensured that the necessity for a write off should not arise for want of timely

and  adequate  action  to  fix  personal  responsibility  and  the  amount  to  be

recovered from each individual.

                     Departmental enquiries regarding frauds, etc., in which Government

Servants are Involved

304.        The general rule is that departmental proceedings should be instituted at the

earliest possible moment against all the Government servants involved in

any loss sustained by the Government on account of fraud, embezzlement or

438

     CHAPTER XI ]    LOSSES OF PUBLIC MONEYS OR PROPERTY              [ ART.  304

any similar offence, and conducted with strict adherence to the rules upto
the point at which prosecution of any one of them begins. At that stage it

should be specifically considered whether it is practicable to carry on the

departmental  proceedings  against  any  of  the  others  any  further  without

waiting for the result of the prosecution; if it is, they should be carried as far

as possible but not, as a rule, to the stage of finding and sentence in the

criminal  proceedings.  If  the  accused  is  convicted,  the  departmental

proceedings against him should be resumed and formally completed.  If the

accused is not convicted, the departmental proceedings against  him should

be dropped  unless the authority competent to take disciplinary action is of

the opinion that the facts of the case disclose adequate ground for taking

departmental action against him. In either  case, the proceedings against the

remaining delinquents should be resumed and completed as soon as possible

after the termination of the proceedings in court.

The  departmental  proceedings  contemplated  in  the  preceding  paragraph

are those regulated by the Kerala Civil Services (Classification, Control and

Appeal) Rules, 1960. When action is taken under the Kerala Public Servants
(Inquiries) Act, 1963 (Act 31 of 1963), this ordinarily takes the place of a

criminal  prosecution  as  regards  the  person  or  persons  accused,  but  the

procedure as regards other persons involved against whom the  Act is not

employed  should  be  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  given  in  the

preceding paragraph.

Notwithstanding anything contained in Article 301 to 303 and in the foregoing
paragraphs,  recovery  proceedings  as  contemplated  in  the  Kerala  Public
Accountants Act, 1963 (Act 37 of 1963) should invariably be taken against
the persons involved in any loss sustained by Government on account of
fraud,  embezzlement  or  any  similar  offence  and  conducted  with  strict
adherence to rules till the loss involved is realised completely.

         Prosecution for Embezzlements of Public Moneys or Property

305.(a) Whenever the Head of an Office finds that there is a reasonable suspicion
that a criminal offence has been committed in respect of any public moneys
or properties belonging to Government or institutions under the control of
the Government (including moneys or properties of co-operative societies),
he  should  as  a  general  rule  report  the  matter  at  once  to  the  Police  and
simultaneously inform the District Collector and Additional District Magistrate
and the Head of his department that he has laid an information before the
Police.

440

However, in cases, of defalcation/embezzlement of public money or properties
in which Government servants or public servants are involved and where the
amount  or  the  value  of  the  properties  involved  is  `  5,000  (Rupees  five
thousand only) or more belonging to State Government (including moneys
or properties of co-operative societies)  they should be reported immediately
to the Local X-Branch Vigilance Division instead of to the ordinary Police.

The  Police/Local  X-Branch  Vigilance  Division    should  then  keep  the
Government servant who laid the information and the District Collector and
Additional District Magistrate informed of the action take in the matter.

For the purpose of this rule the term ‘Public Servant’ will have the meaning
assigned to it under the explanation to Section 161 of the Indian Penal Code
as amended by the Kerala Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1962 (27 of 1962).

       (b)    When the case is heard by the court, the Head of the Office concerned should see
that all the witnesses serving in his department and all documentary evidence in
the control of his department are punctually produced. He should also appoint a
Government servant of the department to attend the proceedings in court and
assist the prosecuting staff.

        (c)     If prosecution for an offense of this kind results in the discharge or acquittal
of  any  person,  or  in  the  imposition  of  any  sentence  which  appears  to  be
inadequate,  the  Head  of  the  Office  concerned  should  at  once  send  a  full
statement  of the facts of the case to the District Collector and Additional

District Magistrate; if the District Collector and Additional District Magistrate
consider that further proceedings should be taken in revision or appeal, he

should proceed as he would in any other case and should keep the Head of

the Office concerned informed regarding the further proceedings. A special

order of the Government is necessary for filing an appeal against an acquittal.

      (d)   The Head of the Office concerned should submit, in addition to the reports

prescribed in Articles 297, 303A and 303B prompt reports to the Government

through the proper channel at each stage regarding:—

               (i)     the commencement of the investigation by the Police/Local X-Branch

        Vigilance Division;

(ii)    the decision to prosecute in any particular case ;

(iii)   the result of any prosecution;

(iv)   the decision to proceed further in revision or appeal in any case; and

(v)    the result of any proceedings in revision or appeal.

        (e)    Notwithstanding anything contained in the preceding portion of this Article, the

Head of the Office concerned may, when he considers it to be desirable refer any
matter through the proper channel for the orders of the Government  before

taking action.

LOCAL  FUNDS

Introductory

306.      The transactions of local funds (as defined in Article 3) are not included as

such in the Government account, except in so far as their cash balances are

deposited with the Government under the rules and accounted for under the

deposit head “Deposits of  Local Funds” within the Public Account. The

Government’s function in regard to such deposits is that of a banker (See

442

Chapter X of this Code and Part VIII of the Kerala Treasury Code).

307.       Some of the important classes of local funds are :-

  (1)         District Funds.

  (2)         Municipal Funds (ie., the moneys of Municipal Councils

governed by the Municipal  Acts).

  (3)         Kerala State Road Transport Corporation Working Fund.

  (4)        Village Panchayat Fund i.e., the moneys of panchayats governed by the

Kerala  Panchayats Act, 1960 (Act 32 of 1960).

  (5)         Kerala State Electricity Board Working Fund.

  (6)         Market Committee Fund.

  (7)         Library  Fund.

308.        Local bodies (as defined in Article 3) perform functions closely allied to those

of the Government and receive aid from the Government in the form of grants

and loans for certain purposes. This Chapter refers to the rules relating to
some of the financial transactions between the Government and the local

bodies.

CHAPTER XII ]

LOCAL  FUNDS

             [ ARTS.  309-312

Grants to Local and Other Bodies

309.         The payment of grants to local and other bodies, e.g., grants for the maintenance
of roads, is governed by the general or special orders of the Government in
regard to such grants.

                The Government may by general or special orders specify the various items
of grants that are payable to local and other bodies on account of certain
fines realised by Courts and credited to the Government. The grant on account
of  these  fines  should  be  drawn,  and  paid  in  the  manner  indicated  in  the
Kerala Treasury Code (See Rule 196, Chapter III, Part V).

Loans to Local Bodies

310.         Rules relating to the execution of work on behalf of local bodies by the Public
Works Department are contained in Articles 31 to 33 of the Kerala Account
Code, Volume III and Chapter 16 of the Kerala Public Works Account Code.
The  detailed  procedure  to  be  followed  in  connection  with  borrowing  by
local bodies from the Government is laid down in the Kerala Local Authorities
Loans Rules, 1965 (See also Article 235.)

Charges recoverable from Local Bodies

311.(a)  When the Government agree to render a service to, or incur a charge on
account of a local body, the estimated amount of the charge or cost of the
service should ordinarily be recovered in advance in accordance with the
principle  laid  down  in Article  34.  In  exceptional  cases,  however,  the
Government may authorise the special arrangements detailed in Article 34.

        (b)   Any amount due to the Government by a local body and remaining unpaid,
443
including any amount overdue for payment in respect of a loan, should be
recovered at the earliest opportunity in the manner indicated in Article 35.

Time-limits for claims by Local Bodies

312.        A local body should prefer its claims for any amount which the Government

have sanctioned for payment to it not later than the latest date specified by

the Government for the payment or, if the Government have not specified

any such date in respect of a particular payment or class of payments, within

six months, from the date on which the local body receives the orders of the

Government authorising the payment [See also Article 55 (c)].

In the case of water supply and drainage schemes or other works for which

the  Government have promised a grant on the post-payment system, the

local body concerned should prefer its claims for the grant within six months

of the execution of the work (or instalment of the work, where the work is

executed  and  paid  for  in  separate  instalments)  unless  the  local  body  has

been definitely informed that the Government will consider the claim only

444

after provision has been included for the purpose in the budget, in which

case the claim for the grant should be preferred within six months of the

execution of the work or within one month of the date of receipt of information

that provision is available in the budget, whichever is later.

Arrear Claims of Local Bodies

313.

A claim preferred by a local body after the latest date specified for it should

not be paid without specific sanction of Government in each case. In the

case of statutory grants, the Government will summarily reject every arrear

claim which is made after the expiry of three years subsequent to the year in

which the claim fell due, and in the case of non-statutory grants and other

amounts due by the Government, they will summarily reject all arrear claims

(See also Article 60).

Note:— In the case of items of revenue collected by the Revenue Department

on  behalf  of  local  bodies,  the  payment  will  be  sanctioned  by  such

authorities as may be specified by the Government from time to time.

CHAPTER    XIII

MISCELLANEOUS  SUBJECTS

Introductory

314.     This chapter contains the financial rules relating to certain miscellaneous

subjects, which do not either fall within the scope of or have not been fully

dealt within the other chapters of the Code.

     Allocation of Expenditure between Capital and Revenue

315.         Expenditure on the public service falls into two broad divisions of expenditure

on revenue account and expenditure on capital account. The latter is called

briefly capital expenditure or capital outlay.

316.        Expenditure of a capital  of a nature is broadly defined as expenditure incurred

with the object of either increasing concrete assets of a material and permanent

character, or of extinguishing or reducing recurring liabilities, such as those

for  future  pensions  by  payment  of  commuted  value.  Expenditure  on  a

temporary asset cannot ordinarily be considered as expenditure of a capital
nature.

317.       Expenditure of a capital nature as defined above, incurred upon a scheme or

project may not, however, be classed as capital expenditure in the Government

accounts unless the classification has been expressly authorised by general

or special orders of Government. Ordinarily such classification will not be

permitted unless—

445
        (i)    It is essential for the exhibition of financial results of any special service

or undertaking on the basis of generally accepted commercial principles,
or in some other conventional manner, either that the cost of the service or

undertaking may be ascertained or that the full implications of any policy

may be clearly demonstrated, or

445

                                      THE  KERALA  FINANCIAL CODE  VOL  I
CHAPTER XIII ]

 [ ARTS.  317-318

        (ii)    The expenditure involved is so large that it cannot reasonably be met from

ordinary revenue.

Note:— The term ‘ordinary revenues’ is applied to revenue derived from taxes,

duties,  fees,  fines  and  similar  items  of  current  Government  income

including extraordinary receipts, if any, as distinct from receipts that

are of a capital or debt, deposits  and banking character.

318.       When it has been decided by Government that the expenditure on a scheme

for the creation of a new or additional asset should be classed as capital

expenditure, and that separate capital and revenue accounts should be kept

446

of such a scheme, the allocation of expenditure to capital and revenue should

be determined in accordance with such detailed rules as may be prescribed

by  Government  according  to  the  circumstances  of  the  department  or

undertaking in which the expenditure is incurred (Vide also Appendix I to

Kerala Account Code, Vol. III). The following are the  main principles applicable

to the treatment of the expenditure in the estimates and accounts:

        (i)    Capital bears all charges for the first construction and equipment of a project

as well as charges for intermediate maintenance of the work while not yet

opened  for  service  and  bears  also  charges  for  such  further  additions  and

improvements as may be sanctioned under rules made by competent authority.

       (ii)   Subject to clause (iii), revenue should bear all subsequent charges for

maintenance and all working expenses. These embrace all expenditure

on the working and up-keep of the project and also on such renewals

and replacements and such additions, improvements or extensions as

under rules made by Government, are debitable to the revenue account.

        (iii)   In the case of works of renewal and replacements, which part-take both of

capital and revenue nature, the allocation of expenditure should be regulated

by the broad principle that revenue should pay or provide a fund for the

adequate replacement of all wastage or depreciation of property originally

446

CHAPTER XIII ]

MISCELLANEOUS   SUBJECTS

   [ ARTS.  318-319

provided  out  of  capital  grants  and  that  only  the  cost  of  genuine
improvements whether determined by prescribed rules of formulae or under

special orders of Government, may be debited to capital. Where under,

special orders of Government a Depreciation or Renewals Reserve Fund is

established  for  renewing  assets  of  any  commercial  department  or

undertaking, the distribution of expenditure on renewals and replacements

between capital and the fund should be so regulated as to guard against

over capitalisation on the one hand excessive withdrawals from the fund

on the other.

                Expenditure on account of reparation of damage caused by extraordinary,

calamities, such as flood, fire, earthquake, cyclone, etc., should be charged

to capital, or to revenue or divided between them in such way as may be

determined by Government according to the circumstances of each case.

      (iv)    Capital receipts in so far as they relate to expenditure previously debited

to capital, accruing during the process of construction of a project should

be utilised in reduction of capital expenditure. Thereafter their treatment in

the accounts will depend on circumstances, but except under special rule

or order of Government, they should never be credited to the ordinary

revenue account of the department or undertaking.

319.        Expenditure debitable to capital will be booked under the appropriate capital

head of accounts prescribed within or outside the revenue account, according

as the funds required to meet such expenditure are provided from ordinary

revenues or from other sources including borrowed money.

447
               Except under special orders of Government, no expenditure previously met

from  ordinary  revenue  may  be  transferred  to  a  capital  head  outside  the
revenue  account.

   [ ARTS.  320-324

320.        Except in special cases regulated by special orders of Government, interest

Interest  on  Capital

at  the  rates  specified  below  should  be  charged  in  the  accounts  of  all
commercial  departments  or  undertakings  for  which  separate  capital  and
revenue  accounts  are  maintained  within  the  Government  accounts.  The
charge should be calculated on the direct capital outlay to the end of the
previous year plus half the outlay of the year itself, irrespective of whether
such outlay has been met from ordinary revenues or from other sources.

    (i)     For capital outlay met out of specific loans raised by Government, at
such  rate  of  interest  as  may  be  prescribed  by  Government,  having
regard  to  the  rate  of  interest  actually  paid  on  such  loans  and  the
incidental charges incurred in raising and managing them.

448

      Note:— By specific loans are meant loans that are raised in the open market
for one specific purpose which is clearly specified in the prospectus
and in regard to which definite intimation is given at the time of the
raising  of  the  loans  that  for  the  purpose  of  accounts  they  are  to  be
regarded as specific loans.

   (ii)     For capital outlay provided otherwise at the average rate of interest to

be determined each year.

321.         When under any special order of Government charges for interest during the
process of construction of a project are temporarily met from capital, the
writing back of capitalised interest should form the first charge on any capital
receipts or surplus revenue derived from the project when opened for working.

Work done for another Government or State

322.       The Head of a department is responsible for seeing that no work (unless it is
negligible in amount ) is done by his department for another Government
without obtaining a definite ruling from the Government as to whether charge
should be made for it or not.

                  Rules regarding charges on account of the maintenance and up-keep of

Government motor cars and motor boats

323.(a)  Charges  for  the  maintenance  and  up-keep  of  a  car  or  boat  supplied  to  a

Government  servant  other  than  the  Ministers  and  the  Speaker  of  the

Legislative Assembly at the public expense will be borne by the Government
servant and by the Government respectively, in the manner indicated below,
the general principle being that the Government servant using the car or
boat shall bear those of its running expenses which are largely dependent as
regards amount on carefulness of management and which affect the continued
efficiency of the conveyance:—

        (i)    The Government servant using the car or boat shall pay the cost  of
petrol, tyre renewals, minor repairs and renewals, lubricants and
illuminants, as well as all occasional storage charges and all petty
charges incurred otherwise than at the periodical overhauling and
annual varnishing.

   Note:– Minor repairs and renewals are those which cost less than ` 50 or
are  not  connected  with  the  prescribed  periodical  overhauling.
Provided that, if a new component costing more than ` 15 is used in
connection with a minor repair or renewal the Government servant
shall be entitled to charge to Government its actual cost but not
any  workshop  charges  on  account  of  the  examination  of  the
defective car or boat and the setting up of the new part.

        (ii)    All other charges shall be paid by Government including wages of
chauffeur and cleaner, the cost of uniform of the chauffeur, and all
charges incurred in connection with the annual varnishing and the
periodical overhauling.

449

     (b)  Charges relating to the maintenance and repairs of motor cars and boats
supplied  for  the  use  of  the  Ministers  and  the  Speaker  of  the  Legislative
Assembly are regulated by the provisions contained in the Kerala Payment
of Salaries and Allowances Act, 1951 (Act 15 of 1951) and Amendment Act,
1968 (Act 2 of 1968) and the rules made thereunder.

Register of Motor Cars and Motor Boats

324.(a)   A register (Log Book) in Form 48, 48A and 48B will be maintained by all offices

and departments maintaining Government owned motor cars, buses, lorries,

jeeps, station wagons, vans and motor boats.

             Where suitable register in other form is already maintained in accordance with

Government  Orders,  the  Head  of  the  Department  may  authorise  its

continuance if he considers it more suitable and convenient than the form of

the register prescribed above.

450

    Note:—  The  Controlling  Officers  will  during  their  inspections,  satisfy

themselves  that  log  books  are  maintained  by  officers  having  the

custody  and  charge  of  vehicles  and  that  the  petrol,  etc.,  purchased

have been accounted for in terms of the kilometres run.

         (b)    A certificate in the following form should be recorded by the drawing officer

in a Contingent Bill containing a claim for petrol and/or oil:-

                “I have examined the log books for the period ending ...........................................

and I certify that the motor vehicles have been used on authorised journeys

and  that  they  have  run  the  prescribed  number  of  kilometres  per  litre.

Recoveries have been effected wherever they are due in accordance with the

rules and credited in chalan No ............................... dated .............................”

The Treasury Officers are authorised to reject the bills which do not contain

the above certificate.

Insurance of Government Property

325.       Government properties may be insured against risks in transit such as loss,

damage, etc., (See also Article 146).

   Note:— The Government do not however insure Government motor cars and

motor boats except sea-going fishing boats for which the risk of damage

is high. But when they supply a Government motor car or motor boat

MISCELLANEOUS   SUBJECTS

      [ ARTS. 325-326

for the use of an officer, in so far as the officer using the car or boat is
responsible  for  damage,  etc.,  it  is  the  officer’s  business  to  protect

himself  against  the  risks  involved  in  the  use  of  the  car  or  boat  by

insurance at his own cost.

              The Transfer of Government Land from one Department to another

326.(a)  The  transfer  of  Government  lands  with  improvements  thereon,  from  one

department to another shall be ordered by the District Collectors and the

       (2)   When any Government land with improvements or buildings in the

possession of one Service Department is transferred to another Service

Department  or  a  branch  of  any  Service  Department  for  a  specific

purpose  of  starting  any  industry  or  commercial  undertaking  of  a

remunerative  nature,  it  shall  be  competent  for  the  Government,  to

order the collection of market value of the lands and improvements

transferred  to  such  Service  Department  or  a  branch  of  the  Service

Department, according to the merits of each case.

         (3)       When any land with improvements thereon or any building is transferred

452

from or to a Commercial Department, the full market value thereof or the

book value whichever is higher should be charged.

          (4)        The  value  of  lands,  improvements  and  buildings  transferred  to  a

Commercial Department under rule (3) or to a Service Department or

Land Acquisition Act and Rules.

       (5)      The classification of the sale proceeds of Government lands and buildings

shall be regulated in accordance with the provisions contained in the Schedule

authority of the Department receiving the lands, etc., and furnishing full

classification  of  the  debit  head  shall  be  forwarded  to  the Accountant
General for effecting the necessary adjustments in this behalf.

          (7)      Payments in cash shall be required in all cases where a Department of the

Government transfers State lands to quasi-Government  institutions like

MISCELLANEOUS   SUBJECTS

   [ ARTS.  326-327

the Kerala State Electricity Board, the Kerala Financial Corporation, etc.
If any separate funds have been constituted for such Boards inside or

outside the public account, the value of the lands transferred shall be

debitable to such funds, unless the Government by general or special

order give directions to the contrary.

        (8)       When the purposes for which the land was transferred to the Service or

Commercial Departments as the case may be, under rules (2) and (3)  has

ceased, or in the event of such land or portion thereof not being required

any  further  by  such  Department  or  Institution,  such  land  or  portion

thereof shall revert to Government and the amount of compensation, if

any, payable to such department shall be fixed by the Collector of the

District  in  which  the  land  is  situated,  provided  that  in  no  case  such

compensation shall be fixed in excess of the value realised under rules (2)

and (3)  as the case may be.

           Pro forma accounts relating to Government Commercial Undertakings

327.        When the operation of a department include undertakings of a commercial or

quasi-commercial character, and the nature and scope of the activities of the

undertakings  are  such  as  cannot  suitably  be  brought  within  the  normal

system  of  Government  account,  the  head  of  the  undertaking  should  be

required to maintain such subsidiary and  pro forma accounts in commercial

form as may be agreed between Government and the Accountant General.

The methods and principles in accordance with which such accounts are to

be kept, including inter alia the basis to be adopted for valuation of assets

and for allocation of expenditure between capital and revenue accounts and

the extent to which the provision should be made in those accounts for bad

debts,  depreciation  and  other  forms  of  indirect  charges,  e.g.,  cost  of
management and supervision, audit charges, interest on capital expenditure,
etc., will be regulated by orders and instructions issued by Government in
each case. Where the commercial accounts are maintained for the purpose

                     [ ARTS.  327-330

of assessment of the cost of an article or service, the head of the undertaking
should  see  that  adequate  regulations  are  framed  with  the  approval  of
Government in order to ensure that the cost deducted from the accounts is
the accurate and true cost. He should also arrange to obtain the orders of
Government  regarding  the  nature  and  form  of    subsidiary  accounts  and
statements, if any, which should be appended to the appropriation accounts
of each year, and submit such accounts and statements to the Accountant
General on such date as may be required by him.

Other Pro forma Accounts
454

328.       Pro forma accounts of regular Government workshops and factories will be
kept in accordance with the detailed rules and procedure prescribed in the
departmental  regulations.  The Accountant  General  may  be  required  by
Government  to  prepare  pro  forma  accounts  of  irrigation  navigation,
embankment and drainage works and of Government residential buildings in
accordance  with  the  instructions  contained  in  Chapter  21  of  the  Central
Account Code, Volume IV.

Service Funds

329.         Rules regulating the General Provident Fund account of Government servants are
contained in the General Provident Fund (Kerala) Rules, the State Provident
Fund (Travancore) Rules, the General Provident Fund (Cochin) Rules and the
General Provident Fund (Madras) Rules. Rules relating to the State Life Insurance
Fund (Official Branch) are available as separate Government Publication.

Treasury Savings Bank

330.      The object of the Government in establishment  of Treasury Savings Bank
Scheme is to provide a ready means for the deposits of savings and so to
encourage thrift. Savings Bank is not to be used for the purpose of keeping
a current account and the Director of Treasuries (Secretary to the Savings

Bank ) is empowered to close accounts, or in the case of accounts opened on

behalf  of  minors  to  stop  the  receipt  of  further  deposits,  should  he  have

454

CHAPTER XIII ]

MISCELLANEOUS   SUBJECTS                   [ ARTS.  330-332

reason to believe that the accounts are being used for a purpose for which
Savings Bank is not intended.

              The procedure relating to transactions in the Savings Bank in Government

treasuries is detailed in Appendix 3 of the Kerala Treasury Code.

Endowments for Scholarships, Prizes, etc.

331.        If any person informs a Government servant that he proposes to place funds

at the Government’s disposal for use as an endowment for the grant of a

scholarship or prize, etc., the Government servant should report the matter

to the Government through the proper channel for orders. The Government

will then take action, if necessary under the Charitable Endowments Act,

1890 (India Act VI of 1890). The Examiner of Local Fund Accounts has been

appointed as the Treasurer of Charitable Endowments for the State.

Application for and Grant of Leave

332.        Rules  relating  to  the  submission  of  applications  for  and  grant  of  leave,

supplementing those contained in the Service Rules are as below:—

        (a)    Gazetted Officers.— Applications should be forwarded to Government

by Heads of Departments through the Audit Office which will submit it

to Government with the necessary certificate regarding the title to the

leave applied for.

                    Whenever  the  Heads  of  Departments  themselves  are  competent  to

sanction  the  leave,  a  certificate  should  be  obtained  from  the Audit

Office  as  regards  the  admissibility  of  the  leave  and  then  the  leave

455

sanctioned.

        In the case of officers having statutory functions such grant of leave

should invariably be communicated in the form of a notification and

published in the Gazette. Copies of sanctions should be sent to the

Audit Office also for information.

CHAPTER XIII ]

   [ ARTS. 332-333

        (b)      Non-Gazetted  Officers.— Applications  should  be  submitted  to  the

authority competent to sanction the leave.

   Note:— These rules apply to leave other than casual leave.

       (c)    Every application for leave (other than leave for which production
of Medical Certificate is prescribed) of a Gazetted Officer which
requires the sanction of Government, should reach Government not
less than a month before the date from which the leave is required.
Similarly, every application for an extension of leave to a Gazetted
Officer should reach Government not less than two weeks before
the date of the expiry of the leave already granted.  Ordinarily, no
Gazetted Officer, who has applied for leave or for an extension of
leave, and to whom such leave or extension of leave has been granted
by Government, will be permitted to cancel any portion of such leave or
extension of leave. Strong grounds must be urged for failure to comply
with the above rules in cases where this becomes absolutely necessary.

456

        (d)     The Head of a Department should not refuse to forward to the Government
the leave application of a Gazetted Officer, in a case in which the Government
alone can grant the leave applied for. No Head of a Department has the
right to curtail the discretion of the Government in regard to the grant (or
refusal) of leave to an officer to whom the Government alone can grant or
refuse such leave. All applications for leave by a Gazetted Officer should,
therefore, be submitted to the Government, in cases in which the leave
applied for is a kind which the Government alone can grant. This does not,
of course, take away from the Head of a Department the discretion of
recommending to the Government to refuse the leave applied for in any
case.

Custody of Valuable Documents

333.(1)  The several documents to be dealt with may be broadly classed under the

following heads:—

       (a)   Securities deposited with a Government Officer ex-officio.

456

CHAPTER XIII ]

MISCELLANEOUS   SUBJECTS

            [ ART.  333

      (b)    Those which relate to some permanent arrangement affecting Government
interests, to which Government is a party, such as deeds of building purchased
by  Government  and  bonds  executed  by  persons  making  permanent
endowments.

       (c)    Those which relate to agreements executed by contractors, agreements

for agricultural and other loans.

      (d)     Documents presented by parties for particular purposes, viz., registration,
or in the course of judicial or other proceedings, before Government officers
and  all  other  classes  of  valuable  documents  not  specifically  referred  to
above.

  (2)  (i)      As regards (a)  Securities in Trust, the statutory rules on the subject

should be strictly followed.

        (ii)      Documents in the possession of the head of an office coming under (b)
should be sent to the Chief Secretary to Government for safe custody as
soon as practicable after the order for record is passed on them by the
proper authority, an office copy thereof being retained if necessary for
reference.

          (iii)     Documents comprised under (c) will ordinarily have to be retained by
the respective Heads of  Departments or District Collectors or District
Treasury Officers or other Officers representing Government in the
transactions till they are finally disposed of.

          (iv)    The procedure regarding papers falling under (d) is to be governed by
statutory rules or departmental orders. Where no such rules or orders
exist the Heads of Departments should prescribe the best arrangement
possible for the safe custody of all such valuable documents with the
approval of Government wherever necessary.

457

          (v)      In all offices, a register of valuable documents in the form given below

should  be  maintained  and  the  receipts  and  disposals  noted  therein

with  the  initials  of  a  responsible  officer. The  documents  should  be

      (vii)    Officers who conduct inspection of Offices, should scrutinise the
register  of  valuable  documents  and  satisfy  themselves  that  the

entries therein are correct and up-to-date and that the rules regarding

the safe custody of such documents are observed.

334.       A record of services of every Government servant should be maintained in

Service Books

accordance with the Service Rules applicable to each case. The Accountant

General will maintain the record for gazetted Government servants in the

“History of Services” which he complies. The head of each office should

maintain the record for each non-Gazetted Government servant working under

him in a service book (or service roll). When an employee is transferred to

another office, his service book should be sent to the head of the office to

which he is transferred and not made over to him, nor should it be given to

him when proceeding on leave. When non-Gazetted Officers are officiating

in gazetted appointments, their service book should be kept by the head of

the office to which each such officer permanently belongs, but when they

are confirmed in such appointments their service book should be forwarded
to the Accountant General’s Office for record.

Register of Books and Periodicals

335. (a)  All books and periodicals received in an office will be entered in a register in

Form 19.

        (b)  Every officer upon receiving charge of an office to which a library or collection
of books, etc., for official use is attached must satisfy himself as to the State of
the library and the books, etc. Unless otherwise reported, it will be assumed that
he received the library or the books, etc., in good order and he will be held
thenceforth personally responsible for any defect.

459

         (c)  All books appearing in the register of books or catalogue of the library on
the last date of March of every year should be counted and examined by the

heads  of  offices  or  institutions  concerned  or  by  one  of  their  Gazetted
Assistants. A certificate to this effect should be furnished by the head of
each office, on the 15th of April every year along with the acknowledgement
for the amount of permanent advance in Form  8  (A)  (See also Article 97).

Erasures

336.        A Government servant should on no account erase or overwrite an entry in
any cash book, account register or schedule. If he finds it necessary to make
a correction he should cancel the incorrect entry neatly in red ink and insert
the correct entry. Whenever a Government servant makes any correction or
interpolation in any such document, he should request the head of office to
authenticate it by writing his dated initials against it [See also Rule 210  (c),
Part V  of the Kerala Treasury Code].

460

Supply of Forms

337.

Standard forms prescribed for use by Government offices including the forms
prescribed in this Code, the Kerala Treasury Code and the Kerala Account
Code will be available for issue from the Printing Department. The forms
should be obtained by indents on the Superintendent, Government Presses,
Trivandrum in accordance with the rules for the supply of forms.

        Destruction of Official Records connected with Accounts

338.           A  competent authority may destroy official records from time to time subject
to the careful observance of the relevant rules contained in the departmental
code or manual and of any other relevant orders of the Government. The

             [ ART.  338

         (c)   When the Government have prescribed a minimum period after which records

of a particular kind may be destroyed, Heads of Departments and other offic-

ers authorised in this behalf may order in writing the destruction of such

records in their own and subordinate offices  on the expiry of that period.

Before the head of an office allows any pay bills or acquittance rolls to be

destroyed he should take care to satisfy himself that the procedure in regard

to the maintenance and verification of service books prescribed in the Ser-

vice Rules has been strictly followed in regard to those pay bills or acquit-

464

tance rolls.

        (d)   The Head of a Department is competent to sanction the destruction of such

other  records  in  his  own  office  and  the  offices  subordinate  to  him  as  he

considers  to  be  useless,  but  he  should  forward  a  list  of  such  records  as

properly appertain to the accounts audited by the Indian Audit Department

to the Accountant General and await his concurrence in their destruction

before ordering them to be destroyed.

        (e)   Heads of  Departments should prepare a comprehensive list of such of the

records as are due for destruction in their own offices, and also get similar

lists from those of their subordinates at the appropriate time. The records

may then be ordered to be destroyed in the presence of a responsible officer

and the record-keeper. The records may be destroyed by burning. If it is

decided to sell useless records as waste paper, care should be taken to see

that every page is torn into small pieces before it is disposed of by sale.

Gazettes, books and periodicals which are no longer required should, however,

be sold intact, as waste paper.

         (f)   Every head of an office should see that lists showing full details of all records

destroyed from time to time are properly prepared and retained permanently.

officer should report the particulars immediately to the Accountant General.
