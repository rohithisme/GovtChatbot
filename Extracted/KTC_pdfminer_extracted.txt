RESPONSIBILITIES  OF  THE  DIRECTOR

39. (a) The  Director  as  the  Head  of  the  Department  of  Treasuries  is
responsible to the Government for the proper functioning of the Treasuries in the
State.  He  shall  inspect  each  district  treasury  at  least  once  in  a  year,  examine
whether the rules relating to the custody of treasure are closely followed, whether
the registers are in good order and kept up-to-date and generally whether the
treasury is working satisfactorily and shall take such effective steps as are necessary
to remedy the defects, if any, noticed by him. In the course of the inspection, he
shall specifically examine and satisfy himself—

(i) that the actual stock of cash, opium, ganja, stamps and securities

is kept under joint lock and key and corresponds with the book balance;

(ii) that the Treasurer does not hold a sum larger than is necessary
for the convenient transaction of the Government business and this sum together
with the value of stamps, opium, ganja and other valuable articles held under the
orders of the Government in his sole custody, is not larger than the security given
by him;

and

(iii) that the stock of draft, cheque, bill and similar forms are carefully
kept under lock and key by the Treasury Officer and periodically tallied with the
balance of such forms on the stock books.

NOTE  1.—The word “Stamps” used in the above rule includes Match Excise

Banderols.

NOTE  2.—Officers inspecting stamps, opium, etc., should record certificates

of verification in their own hand.

NOTE  3.—Appendix  5  contains  the  detailed  rules  prescribed  by  the
Government  for the inspection of District Treasuries. The Director
should see during his inspection of the treasury that the stock
of stamps  especially those of denominations for which there
is no demand  or only occasional demand, is not excessive. He
should  pass  orders  at  the  time  of  inspection  regarding  the
disposal  of  any  surplus  stock  of  stamps.

                                                                   21

PART  II

RULE  39

(b)   (1) Each district treasury will be inspected periodically by an

Officer of the Indian Audit Department.

(2) A brief report of such inspection will be drawn up and sent
to the Director with a copy to the Treasury Officer. The report will be in two
parts, the first part dealing with the observance of the rules regarding the
custody of treasure, coinage, currency, remittance and public debt work as
well as the maintenance of the Currency Chest Accounts and the second part
dealing with other points. The Accountant General will also send a copy of
the first part of the report to the Currency Officer, Reserve Bank of India,
Madras.

(3) The Treasury Officer shall send his replies on each part of
the  report  in  duplicate  to  the  Director  who  shall  pass  such  orders  as  he
considers necessary and send a copy of his orders together with one copy of
the reply received from the Treasury Officer to the Accountant General who
will finally dispose of the report. The Treasury Officer shall also send a copy
of  his  replies  on  the  first  part  of  the  report  of  inspection  to  the  Currency
Officer, Madras. The Currency Officer will forward his copy of the report
and  of  the  Treasury  Officer’s  reply  thereon    to  the Accountant  General
indicating whether, so far as matters dealt with by the  Reserve  Bank  are
concerned,  the  action  taken  is  adequate  or  whether  any  further  action  is
required. The Accountant General may again refer to the Director any matter
brought  to  notice  in  the  report  in  respect  of  which  he  considers  that  the
action taken by the Treasury and the Director is inadequate. Points which
cannot even then be settled and all important irregularities will be reported
to the Government by the Accountant General.

(4)  The Accountant General will include a summary of the
general  results  of  the  inspections  in  his  annual  review  of  the  working  of
treasuries submitted to the Government.

*NOTE—The Joint Director/Regional Deputy Directors as the case may be,
are empowered to conduct the inspection of District Treasuries on
behalf  of  the  Director,  once  in  every  year  and  notes  on  such
inspection shall be forwarded to Accountant General (A&E) through
the Director of Treasuries. The Inspection reports in respect of District
Treasuries and Sub Treasuries conducted by Accountant General’s
Inspection Wing will be forwarded to the Director, who will retransmit
reports to Joint Director/Regional Deputy Directors as the case may
be for review and finalisation.

notice of the Director by the Accountant General the Director shall make an
investigation  and  pass  such  orders  as  he  considers  necessary  except  in  cases
where the Accountant General has finally disposed of the matter by awarding a
“Treasury Irregularity” to the concerned Treasury Officer a copy of the orders
passed by the Director should be sent to the Accountant General.

NOTE.—A list of cases in which the Accountant General usually awards “Treasury
Irregularity” is given in Appendix 26. Part A of the Appendix contains a
list of serious irregularities which require disciplinary action and Part B
contains a list of ordinary irregularities which have the cumulative effect
of judging the quality of work of the Officer-in-charge of the Treasury at
the time of committing the irregularity.

41. When an Officer takes charge of the post of Director otherwise than
temporarily, he shall obtain from the outgoing Director, a note prepared by the
latter indicating his general impressions on the working of the Treasuries in the

immediately as it comes to his knowledge.

42. The Director of Treasuries shall verify the cash balance (including the
imprest balance and other anamath balances) in each District Treasury at least
once in three months, without giving prior intimation about it to any member of
the staff of the Treasury. The fact of verification should be recorded in the relevant
registers kept in the Treasury. A certificate of verification specifying the amount,
should also be sent to the Accountant General and to Government in the Finance
Department.

The verification shall be done by the Director of Treasuries in person. If he
is unavoidably prevented from conducting the verification himself, he shall depute
an officer in the Directorate, not below the rank of a District Treasury Officer** to
verify the cash balance on his behalf.

RULE  68

(a) visit the bank in person, take over the keys of the strong room
and other receptacles of treasure, notes or books and ensure that the strong
room is properly secured and direct the guard to report to him;

(b) give telegraph information as the occurrence to the Local Head

Office/Head Office of the concerned bank; and

(c) arrange  for  the  due  transaction  of  urgent  treasury  business  at
the  bank.The  responsibility  for  performing  the  functions  herein  stipulated
should, in the first instance, be primarily that of:—

(i) the Collectors at district headquarters.

(ii) the Revenue Divisional Officers at the headquarters of the

 Revenue Division, and

(iii) the Tahsildars of the respective taluks at other places.

The concerned government official should, on no account, take any action
in regard to the bank’s private business, which together with the ordinary treasury
business  which  is  not  of  an  urgent  nature  should  remain  in  abeyance  till  a
responsible official of the concerned bank takes charge of the branch.

When it is impossible for the concerned government official to take the
action mentioned above in person, e.g. on account of absence in camp, he may
delegate his functions in this connection to any other government official not
below the rank of a confirmed Sub Treasury Officer, who is within easy reach of
the branch of the bank. He should nominate such government official for this
purpose specially on each occasion when the necessity arises.

Neither the government nor any government servant will incur any sort
of responsibility either to the State Bank of India or to its subsidiaries or to
any third party by reason of anything done bona fide under this rule. The
Government Official concerned would however, be responsible for the safe
keeping, as a bailee, of the keys of the strong room, etc., taken over by him and
the accounting for the cash and other contents which he takes out from the
strong room.

irregularities in the same way as those at the district treasury. He shall examine
and regulate the procedure of sub treasuries, as far as he can from the daily
examination of their accounts.

NOTE.—If  the  Treasury  Officer,  owing  to  the  volume  of  sub  treasury

treasury voucher, he may at his direction leave over the work to the
Assistant Treasury Officer and/or the Section Heads of the Accounts
Department,  a  percentage  check  not  less  than  20  per  cent  being

treasury has been actually counted and certified by the Sub Treasury Officer
on the closing day. The cash balance of the sub treasury must be written in

CLOSING  FOR  THE  DAY

75. Subject  to  the  directions  contained  in  this  behalf  in  the  Kerala
Account Code, Volume II, the process of closing accounts for the day shall be
as follows:-

(a) The daily total of each subsidiary register will be entered in the
appropriate part of the Day Book, which will then be totalled and the balance
memorandum at the top of the Section Head’s balance sheet will be drawn
up strictly in accordance with the directions contained in the Kerala Account
Code, Volume II. To the account balance thus brought out the additions and
deductions indicated at foot of the Day Book form will be applied so as to
bring out the cash balance at the district treasury.

(b) Meantime,  the  Treasurer  will  also  sum  both  sides  of  his  Day
Book and draw up his balance memorandum in the form of the Treasurer’s
daily balance sheet, Form T.R. 3 or T.R. 4, as the case may be.

(c) If the results shown in the two balance sheets agree, the Treasury
Officer should sign the two Day Books and the two balance sheets. He should
first satisfy himself of the correctness and good order of all these documents
and should give special attention to the reconcilement of the account balance
of the district with that actually in the headquarters treasury; the latter excludes
the balance in sub treasuries or under remittance within the district which the
former includes.

(d) The following is memorandum of some of the more important

parts of the verification. The Treasury Officer should:—

(i) compare each entry of payment in a register with the payment
order ticking off each voucher as it is passed. This will not be necessary if the
Treasury  Officer  adopts  the  alternative  plan  having  the  account  entry
presented to him for initials at the same time that he signs the order of payment;

(ii) examine at least two of the totalling on each side, marking the

totals as “Exd”;

(iii)

see the totallings  are correctly carried from the register to

the Day Book, initialling the totals as he thus compares them;

                                                                   35

PART  II

RULE  75

NOTE.—This must be done, in the case of receipt registers even when the total
for the day is blank; but it is not necessary to initial blank payment
registers. If the number of blank receipt register is large the following
plan may be adopted. Such registers as are only rarely required for entry
may be bound in a single volume and kept under the Treasury Officer’s
own lock. When the volume is required for entry, he should give out of
register for the purpose, and he should receive it back at the time of
signing the daily accounts, carefully seeing in doing so that all new
entries in it are correctly carried to the Day Book and initialling them
accordingly. It is obviously necessary to guard against fraud or mistake
of omitting to bring all entries from these registers upon the Day Book;
and this precaution is not complete if the Treasury Officer examines
only those registers from which an entry is made upon the Day Book.

(iv) verify the totalling of the Day Book or get it done by some
principal subordinate officer other than the Accountant who should initial it is
correct;

(v) see twice every week that all vouchers are properly arranged.

(e) Before signing the Treasurer’s daily balance sheet, the Treasury
Officer should roughly verify the balance in the sole charge of the Treasurer,
as shown in that sheet, and satisfy himself on the following points:-

(i) that no uncurrent coins are left in charge of the Treasurer;

(ii) that no more small silver and copper, bronze and nickel coin

is so left than is actually required for current use;

(iii) that the whole balance in sole charge of the Treasurer never

exceeds his current requirements.

(f) when a deficiency is found in the cash balance of any day it should
be  made  good  at  once  by  the  person  responsible  for  it  and  the  closing  cash
balance of the day should be the full balance including the amount lost and made
good. If, however, for any exceptional reason the amount of deficiency is not
immediately restored to the treasury balance, it should be charged in the accounts
of the day on which the deficiency is discovered under “8550. Civil Advances—
Other Advances—Other  items”  on  a  voucher  signed  by  the Treasury  Officer
specifying  the  name  of  the  person  who  should  make  good  the  amount.  The
amount recovered should be credited to the same head of account. “8550. Civil
Advances—Other Advances—Other items”.

                                                                   36

PART  II

RULE  75

When any excess is found in the cash balance, it should be credited to
Revenue Deposit on the day on which the excess is found, pending enquiry
and disposal of the amount. If the enquiry does not establish beyond doubt
that  the  excess  is  due  to  a  particular  person,  it  should  be  credited  to
Government under “0070 Other Administrative Services-C Other Services-
Other receipts-Other items”. If the amount is proved to be payable to any
particular person, the refund should be made under the orders of the Director
of Treasuries

Such  deficiencies  or  excess  should  be  reported  to  the  Director  of

Treasuries and Accountant General.

(g) The  Treasury  Officer  should  always  be  careful  to  sign  the
Treasurer’s balance sheet in the evening of the day itself to which it refers
but the signature and comparison of the Day Book need not be made till the
following morning unless the office is to be closed for two or more days.
The  Section  Head’s  balance  sheet  must  not  be  signed,  until  it  has  been
carefully agreed with the Treasurer’s.

NOTE.—Ordinarily, the Treasurer’s balance sheet should be compared and
agreed with that of the Assistant Treasury Officer and/or the Section
Heads of the Accounts Department before closing the treasury for
the day and it is only when pressure of work renders this impossible
that the comparison may be postponed till the following morning.
When this is necessitated, the certificate over the Treasury Officer’s
signature  at  foot  of  the  Section  Head’s  balance  sheet  should  be
altered in manuscript by cancelling the words “agreed with the Section
Head’s daily balance sheet and” before the form is signed by the
Treasury  Officer  which  must  be  done  before  closing  the  day. An
additional certificate will then be added and signed by the Treasury
Officer in the following morning viz., “agreed with the Section Head’s
daily balance sheet”. For the 31st March and the first few days of
April it will be necessary for the Assistant Treasury Officer and/or
the Section Heads of the Accounts Department to prepare a separate
rough balance sheet on each of these days for comparison with that
of the Treasurer as the completion of the Assistant Treasury Officer
and/or the Section Heads of the Accounts Department balance sheet
for  the  31st  march  has  to  await  the  receipt  of  the  Sub  Treasury
accounts.

                                                                   37

RULES  75-77

(h) The  foregoing  provisions  of  this  rule  apply  also  to  treasuries
which  transact  their  cash  business  through  the  Bank  subject  to  the
modification that the correctness of the daily accounts should be tested by
a comparison of the totals of receipts and payments in the day Book with the
corresponding totals in the daily accounts received from the Bank also.

NOTE.—When  with  the  concurrence  of  the Accountant  General  the  daily
account of the Bank is submitted to a treasury in the morning of the
day following that to which it refers, the signature and comparison
of the Day Book may be made in the evening instead of in the morning
of the day on which the Bank’s accounts are received, provided the
pressure of work renders it necessary to so postpone it.

CLOSING  FOR  THE  MONTH

76. (1) The  monthly  accounts  of  the  District  Treasury  shall  be  kept
open till the receipt of daily sheets of every Sub Treasury subordinate to it
for the entire period of the month. Every effort shall be made to close the

later than the 6th of the succeeding month.

(2) The monthly accounts of each non-banking Sub Treasury should
be closed on the last working day of each calendar month. Those of each
banking  Sub  Treasury  shall  be  closed  on  the  working  day  immediately
following the last working day of each calendar month i.e., after accounting
the transactions taking place at the bank on the last working day of the month.
The transactions of every Sub Treasury for each day shall be included in the
accounts  of  the  District  Treasury  on  the  day  on  which  the  daily  sheet  is
received except in the case of daily sheets pertaining to one calendar month
received in the District Treasury on or after the first of the succeeding month
in which case the transactions as per such daily sheets shall be included in
the District Treasury accounts for the last working day of the calendar month
to which they relate.

77. (1) In closing the accounts of the District Treasury for the month,
the  month’s  total  of  the  subsidiary  registers  will  be  carried  into  the  cash
account in the case of receipts and into the list of payments in the case of
payments,  the  cash  account  being  closed  in  accordance  with  directions
contained in the Kerala Account Code Volume II. The cash must be verified by
actual counting and the cash balance report made out in accordance with the
procedure prescribed in Part IV.

                                                                   38

PART  II

RULES  77-79

(2) The monthly cash account shall be subjected to very careful
check by the Treasury Officer when it is laid before him. He must satisfy
himself that the opening and closing balances of this account are not merely
deductions from accounts but are statements of facts certified to have been
verified by actual enumeration of coins and notes. The Treasury Officer shall
also  check  each  entry  in  the  cash  account  and  list  of  payments  with  the
corresponding totals in the Day Book and see that the totals of all the registers
are correctly carried into the Day Book.

NOTE.—If, at any time, the Treasury Officer be unable to compare all, at least
he may compare some; notably, he should compare the entries in the
plus and minus memorandum of deposits, stamps, etc., with the entries
in the account, for example if the plus and minus memorandum shows
a reduction in the stock of judicial stamps to the value of  `  5,000 and
if the credit in account be less, the difference must be traced and
satisfactorily accounted for.

MONTHLY  ACCOUNTS  AND  RETURNS

78. (1) A complete list of treasury accounts and returns to be rendered
on different prescribed dates to the Accountant General, the Currency Officer
and other authorities shall be kept at each treasury. The accounts and returns
should be written up in accordance with the directions contained in this behalf
in the Kerala Account Code, Volume II, and such orders and instructions as
may be issued by the Director.

(2) With  regard  to  the  punctual  submission  of  the  accounts  and
return the Government shall view with displeasure any avoidable delay on the
part of the Treasury Officer in the despatch of the prescribed accounts and
returns with complete schedule and vouchers, particularly those required by
the Government, the Accountant General, and the Currency Office concerned.

NOTE.—The returns due for despatch on a holiday may be sent one day (but

not more than one day) late.

79. Vouchers pertaining to each schedule relating to the cash account
or the list of payments shall be numbered consecutively in a separate monthly
series  and  kept  under  lock  and  key  in  order  of  payment  till  they  are
despatched.  Before  despatch  of  the  lists  of  payments  and  schedules,  the
Treasury Officer shall by inspection satisfy himself that the required vouchers
are all attached. He may find it profitable at intervals during the month to take
up a schedule and see that all its vouchers are present in proper order and as
no payment can be made without a voucher, there can be no excuse for the
absence of any unless it be that for a specific remittance.

                                                                   39

certificate of count recorded on the fly-leaf. Ordinarily more
than one book should not be used at one and the same time
and  a  new  book  should  be  brought  into  use  only  after  the
old  one  is  exhausted.  The  stock  register  of  receipt  books
should show the dates on which a book was brought to use
and the date on which it was completed. Counterfoils of used
receipt  books  should  be  kept  under  lock  and  keys  in  the
personal  custody  of  the  head  of  the  office.

should  see  that  the  cheque  reaches  the  government  servant  authorised  to
receive  it  not  later  than  the  day  before  the  fixed  date.  If  the  cheque  is  so
received and is honoured on presentation, the payment should be treated as
having been made on the due date. When a cheque is received on the fixed
date or later, the date when the amount is credited in the Government account
after realization of the cheques should be treated as the date of payment;

*Provided that in the case of dues to the Motor Vehicles Department
which are remitted in the form of Demand Drafts drawn on banks conducting
Government business, the payment will be treated as having been made in
time, even if the Demand Draft is presented to the Officer authorised to receive
it on the due date only.

NOTE.—“Demand drafts” shall not be distinguished from cheques for the

purpose  of  these  rules.

provisions in the departmental manuals, codes, orders, etc., creating the fund
as to the manner in which detailed accounts of the fund are to be kept, detailed
accounts shall be kept, in the following manner, namely:—

(1)

In cases where the amount deposited has to be refunded to
the  remitter  or  in  cases  where  the  deposits  lapse  to  Government  after  a
specific period, the government servant administering the fund shall maintain
a simple ledger account in Form T.R.7B and also a register of deposits in Form

entered in the register of deposits as a distinct item assigning serial numbers
in chronological order in separate series for each financial year. The directions
contained in Article 64 to 67 of Kerala Account Code, Volume -II shall be
followed  mutatis  mutandis  by  the  government  servants  concerned  in
maintaining the above registers;

(2)

In  other  cases  the  government  servant  administering  the
deposit account shall maintain only a simple ledger account in Form T.R.
7B for all transactions pertaining to the deposits;

(3)

In both the cases specified in clauses (1) and (2), the entries
are to be made in the accounts as and when the transactions occur. When the
amounts are received direct by the Government Servant, entries of receipt are
to be made while issuing receipts in Form T.R.5 or T.R. 6 and when remittances
are made at the Treasury by the parties when the parties produce the receipted
chalans. Entries of withdrawals are to be made as and when the cheques for
withdrawal are drawn and issued. If the date of actual remittance into the
Treasury or date of payment at the Treasury differ from the dates of receipt
and  withdrawals  noted  in  the  above  accounts,  the  actual  date  of  treasury
transactions shall be noted in red ink below the date originally entered. In

In  whatever  manner  the  accounts  are  maintained,  the
Government  servant  concerned  should  reconcile  his  accounts  periodically
at least once in a month with the accounts kept by the treasury and prepare a
reconciliation statement at the end of each month and see that the closing
balance of the month  (T.R. 7B) agrees with the balance in the account kept
by the Treasury, subject to the deductions on account of cheques issued, but
not cashed and additions on account of remittances made at the Treasury, but
not incorporated in the Administrator’s P.D. Accounts. He should also furnish
to the Treasury at the end of each financial year a certificate showing the
closing  balance  in  the  account  as  on  the  31st  March  of  each  year  after
reconciling  the  balance  with  the Treasury  figures.  In  the  case  of  Personal
Deposits which lapse to Government after a specific period, the Government
Servant administering the P.D. account, should also prepare and furnish to
the Treasury before the 15th April every year a statement of deposits lapsed
to the Government at the  close  of each financial year and deduct the amount
so lapsed from the opening balance for the next year.

Normally  payments  in  such  cases  are  made  by  the
Treasurer  of  Charitable  Endowments,  only  on  receipt
of  requisition  from  the  administrators  for  amounts
required for immediate disbursement and it will not be
necessary to credit the amount again to the Government
account. In order, however, to ensure that no unutilized
amount is retained by the administrators, they shall send
certificates  of  disbursements  to  the  Treasurer  of
Charitable Endowments together with unutilized balance,
if any, which shall be credited into the Personal Deposit
Account.

(c) In the case of cash in the hands of administrators, which

Treasurer  of  Charitable  Endowments,  shall  remit  into
the treasury for credit under the deposit head mentioned
above, all amounts received by them and draw the sums
again when required. Administrators having custody of
properties,  other  than  securities  held  by  the  Treasurer
of Charitable Endowments, shall remit the income from
such  properties  to  the  deposit  head  and  draw  it  again
when  required.

(e) As  the  deposit  will  be  operated  upon  by  government
servants  belonging  to  several  departments  in  their
capacity  as  administrators  of  the  endowments,  the
Government  in  the  Revenue  Department  shall  control
the  transactions  in  the  account  and  render.

Scheme  of  Merit  Scholarships  administered  by  the  Ministry  of
Education  will  be  paid  in  advance  in  two  installments  to  the
institutions in which the scholars are undergoing studies. The head
of each institution (whether Government or private) receiving such
amounts is permitted to open a personal deposit account in his name
in the local treasury. The amounts received by him for payment of
the above mentioned scholarships should be credited to the personal
deposit account and the amounts actually required for disbursement
should be withdrawn by means of cheques whenever necessary.

94. Issue of duplicates or copies of receipts.—No government servant
may issue a duplicate or copy of a receipt granted for money received by
him on the allegation that the original receipt has been lost or is not available.
A certificate may, when necessary, be given that on a specified day a certain
sum was received on a certain account from a certain person, and a fee of
*two rupees shall be levied for every such certificate issued to a private party.
This prohibition extends only to the issue of duplicate on the allegation that
the original has been lost, and does not apply to cases authorised by these
rules  or  by  special  orders  of  the  Government  in  which  duplicates  may  be
prepared and tendered with the originals.

should be entered in the cash account as “Receipts” as and when received
and as “disbursements” when remitted to the treasury for encashment, just
like moneys received by a government servant-vide Rule 92(b) and (c). If a
large number of cheques is received daily, they should be initially entered
in a subsidiary register in Form T.R. 8 for watching the encashment of the
cheques and only the daily total of receipts and remittances accounted for
in the cash book.

NOTE.—Commission charges collected from parties for collection of cheques

shall be entered in a separate column.

SPECIAL  TO  THE  JUDICIAL  DEPARTMENT

96.

(a) Receipts of moneys by Civil Courts.—In certain cases specified
by the High Court in which money can be disbursed forthwith, e.g., money
paid by suitors for the service of summonses and diet money of witnesses
deposits are received direct at the court and the parties are not required to pay
the money into the treasury or the Bank. A person who wishes to make any
such deposit should present with the money a receipt in the prescribed form
stating fully the particulars and the purpose of the deposit. The Officer of the
court  who  is  authorised  to  receive  the  money  should  receive  it,  sign  the
receipt and return it at once to the depositor.

(b) Receipts of moneys by Criminal Courts.—Magistrates trying Railway
cases under sections, 112, 113 and 115 of the Indian Railways Act, shall subject to

T.R. 9 for the cash actually received by him and simultaneously enter the
amount in the cash book. A final receipt in Form T.R. 10 in confirmation of each
temporary receipt should be signed by the Divisional or Sub Divisional Officer,
as the case may be, and issued to the payer as soon as that officer returns to
headquarters.

When a Section Officer collects revenue from parties to whom grass
plots, fruit trees, canal berms, etc., are leased or receives money from the
sale of materials, etc., and when any government servant who is not in charge
of a cash book similarly receives any money on behalf of the Government in
exceptional circumstances, he should keep it separate from the imprest and

the Sub Divisional Officer (or other nearer superior officer having a cash
book). Along with the money he should send a remittance slip in Form T.R.
11 on the back of which he should enter full particulars of the amount in
question and the date of receipt by him. He should also send a copy of the
remittance slip to the Divisional Officer for check of the receipt entry which
should  appear  in  the  copy  of  the  sub  divisional  or  other  cash  book.  The
Section Officer or other government servant who receives the money in the
first instance should also issue promptly to the payer a temporary receipt in
Form T.R. 9. The Sub Divisional Officer or other nearer superior officer who
maintains a cash book should, on receiving the remittance slip with the money
fill in the two forms of memorandum of acknowledgement attached thereto in
duplicate, make the necessary entry in the cash book and send forthwith to
the government servant who collected the money a copy of the memorandum
of acknowledgment and final receipt in Form T.R.10 for issue to the payer in
confirmation of the temporary receipt. If the memorandum of acknowledgment
and final receipt are not received by the government servant who collected
the money within one week of his sending the cash he should forthwith report
the fact in writing to the Sub Divisional Officer by name and obtain them.

NOTE—1 The forms for temporary and permanent receipts (Forms T.R.

treasury or the Bank, are utilised to meet departmental payments, the gross
receipts and the payments made therefrom shall be entered as receipts and
expenditure  in  any  record  that  may  be  kept  of  the  payments  into  and
withdrawals  from  the  Government  Account  and  accounted  for  to  the
Accountant General. If the receipts are in excess of payments made, the excess
shall be remitted to the treasury or the Bank, as the case may be, and save
where it is otherwise provided in these, the officer making such remittance
shall note on the memorandum or chalan presented under Rule 99(c) the full
amount  of  cash  actually  received  by  him,  and  per  contra,  the  expenses
disbursed therefrom, and not merely the net receipts.

to  one  head  of  account  and  partly  to  another,  a  separate  chalan  shall
ordinarily  be  presented  for  the  amount  to  be  credited  to  each  head.
If,  however,  two  or  more  credits  relating  to  the  same  transaction  are  so
closely connected that it would be convenient to use separate chalans for
them, they shall be entered on the same chalan.

(c) The chalan shall be prepared in Form T. R. 12, or in such other
form as may be prescribed under these rules or in a departmental manual
or code. These forms, shall be printed both in English and Malayalam.

place as the treasury at which the chalan is presented.

Remittances  to  treasury  on  account  of  over-payments  should  be
supported by chalans in triplicate, containing full particulars of the number

between the Chalan Number Book (T.R. 16) and the Day Book on the one hand
and the usual agreement between the Day Book and the Treasurer’s Cash
Book on the other. The Section Head/Junior Superintendent shall examine the
Chalan Number Book at the close of every day and certify that the amounts
credited to Government and the amounts for which receipts have been given,
have been agreed to and initial the certificate. The Treasurer’s Cash Book
shall have a continuous serial number for each month both for receipt and
payment items. Entries shall be made in the chalan number book in the serial
order, so that a cross check with the entries in the Treasurer’s Cash Book
would be easy.

withdrawn instead of cash. On receiving this voucher, the departmental officer
should verify the entries in it, countersign it and forward it to the treasury or
sub treasury concerned as soon as possible, to enable the Treasury or Sub
Treasury Officer to initial the entry in Postmaster’s treasury pass book when
he receives it and complete the transaction.

111. A Treasury or Sub Treasury Officer should receive payment of a
revenue money order in cash. The transaction should be adjusted by a transfer
in the accounts on a receipt in the prescribed form signed by the Postmaster
for total amount of the revenue money orders to be paid each day.

This procedure applies also to the payment of an ordinary money order
payable to a Collector, Treasury Officer or Sub Treasury Officer in his official
capacity. The transaction should be adjusted by a transfer in the accounts,
and the necessary entries in the revenue registers should be made from the
money order coupon or treasury advice. Ordinary money orders payable to
any other government servant in his official capacity should also be paid by
transfers  in  the  accounts,  if  the Treasury  or  Sub Treasury  Officer  sends  a
Postmaster  a  written  requisition  to  that  effect.  Money  orders  payable  to  a
local body which has a banking account with the treasury should also be paid
by transfers in the accounts.

112. Numbering of chalans.—The chalans relating to each subsidiary
register  shall  be  numbered  in  a  separate  monthly  consecutive  series,  and
those which are entered directly in the day book shall bear a separate series of
numbers. The chalans which accompany payments of revenue deposits or
civil and criminal courts’ deposits shall however be numbered in a separate
annual series for each department.

113. Village remittance.—The money shall be sent to the treasury in
sealed bags together with a village remittance list in the form prescribed in the
Departmental Manuals or orders and a chalan in the form of an extract of the
cash  book  prescribed  in  the  Departmental  Manuals  or  Orders. After  the
remittance list and the chalan have been checked, the Treasury Officer shall
sign the remittance list and return it to the person who brought the remittance
to  be  tendered  to  the Treasurer  along  with  the  sealed  bags. The Treasurer
shall take the bags, break the seals in the presence of the village official or
messenger who brought the remittance, and count and test the money. If the
amount is found to be correct the Treasury Officer shall certify to that effect at
the foot of remittance list and return it to the person who brought the remittance.

                                                                   70

RULES  113-114

If any counterfeit or uncurrent note or coin or any deficiency is found, the
Treasurer shall at once bring the fact to the notice of the Treasury Officer, who
shall, if satisfied that the note or coin is counterfeit or uncurrent or that there
is a deficiency, examine the village official or messenger who brought the
remittance and record the fact on the remittance list.

114. Anamaths.—All moneys paid into the Government account at a
treasury shall be credited immediately on the receipt under the appropriate
heads  of  account  in  the  Government  accounts  and  shall  form  part  of  the
general treasury balance. As a general rule, no sums of money shall be kept in
a  treasury  strong  room  unless  they  have  been  paid  into  the  Government
account and form part of the general treasury balance, but the following items
shall be treated as exceptions to this rule and dealt with in accordance with the
special instructions which apply to them:—

(a)
open for transactions,

a village remittance which is received, when the treasury is not

(b)

a treasury or currency remittance which is received when the

treasury is not open for transactions,

(c)

other money sent by a government servant from a distance for
payment into the treasury (or paid in respect of postal money orders) which is
received when the treasury is not open for transactions,

(d) money contained in the cash chests, etc., deposited by other

offices for safe custody (See Rules 157 to 160), and

(e)

the  balance  of  the  permanent  advance  and  imprests,  and
undisbursed  balances  of  amounts  drawn  from  the  treasury  or  otherwise
received for disbursement (See Rules 432  and 433).

The moneys described under items (a) to (e) above shall be placed in the
strong  room  on  the  day  when  they  are  received  and  brought  to  account
immediately when the treasury opens on the next working day. The treasurer
shall maintain an Anamath Balance Register in Form T.R. 19 for recording
these Anamath transactions and a separate column shall be provided for each
class of items concerned. The opening balance, the totals of the daily receipts
and  the  daily  disbursement  respectively  and  the  closing  balance  shall  be
entered in each column. The Treasury Officer shall check this register every

evening,  verify  the  various  closing  balances  with  the  actual  cash,  bags  of
coin and cash chests, etc., in the strong room and initial the register in token
of  the  correctness  of  the  entries.

115.

If a village remittance arrives at a treasury when it is not open for
transactions,  the  sealed  bag  or  bags  containing  it  should  be  placed  in  the
strong room as soon as possible and kept in a special late remittance chest. A
counterfoil receipt form from a book consecutively numbered should be given
in exchange for the bag. As soon as the treasury opens on the next working
day,  the  bag  should  be  taken  out,  the  money  counted  and  tested,  and  the
amount brought to account. The receipt given for the sealed bag should be
taken back and pasted on to the counterfoil. A register should be maintained
in Form T.R. 20 and the date of receipt and date of return of each sealed bag
containing a village remittance and the date on which the amount is brought
to account should be noted in it.

NOTE.—Remittances received by 3 p.m. should, if possible, be shroffed and
brought to account that day. The treasury should be closed by sunset.
Remittances received after 3 p.m. but before sunset should simply be
sealed and kept in the strong room for the night, no attempt being
made to shroff them and bring them to account.

116.

If a treasury or currency remittance arrives at a treasury when it is
open  for  transactions  but  it  is  not  possible  to  count  and  test  the  money
completely on the day of receipt, it should nevertheless be brought to account
on  the  day  of  receipt  and  should  also  be  entered  in  a  register  in  Form
T.R. 21. The counting and testing should be completed as soon as possible
and,  if  any  deficiency  or  any  counterfeit  or  uncurrent  note  or  coin  is
discovered, it should be made good by the Chief Treasurer or Treasurer, if
any, who came with the remittance. Otherwise, the amount should be drawn
on a simple receipt as an advance and placed in the treasury or currency chest
and the necessary steps taken for the adjustment of the advance.

If a treasury or currency remittance arrives at a treasury when it is not
open for transactions, it should be entered in the same register in Form T.R. 21
and  placed  in  sealed  bags  in  the  strong  room  as  soon  as  possible  without
opening the receptacles in which it arrives (See Rule 158). It should be brought
to account as soon as the treasury opens on the next working day.

                                                                   72

If any money sent by postal money order or by a Government
servant from a distance, for payment into the treasury arrives at the treasury
when it is not open for transactions, it should be recorded in the register in
Form T.R. 19 mentioned in Rule 114, placed in the strong room in sealed
bags  as  soon  as  possible  and  brought  to  account  as  soon  as  the  treasury
opens on the next working day.

118. No sums of money which have been sent to a treasury for payment
into the Government account should be kept in Anamath for want of information
as to the nature of the credit or pending confirmation of a sale.The total cash
balance of all the outstanding items in the Anamath Balance Register (See
Rule 114) should be entered at the close of the day in following places in the
accounts:—
(1)

In a sub-treasury

: Treasurer ’s  daily  balance  sheet
(Form  T.R. 4) Day Book (Form T.A. 4
in   the Kerala Account  Code, Vol. II).
Daily sheet (Form T.A. 7 in the Kerala
Account Code, Vol. II).

(2) 

In a district treasury : Treasurer’s  daily  

balance 

sheet

(Form T.R. 4).

The Treasury Officer should verify the balance every evening.

119. Undisbursed balance.—Separate registers should be maintained
for recording the transactions relating to each class of undisbursed balances
such as those relating to amounts payable for the acquisition of land, cash
orders or military pensions. [In regard to undisbursed balances of pay and
allowances, See Rule 432 (c)]. Each such register should show the opening
balance,  receipt,  disbursement  and  closing  balance  of  each  day  on  which
there is any transaction. The Treasury Officer should verify daily that the
closing balance in each such register agrees with the balances entered in the
Anamath Balance Register (Form T. R. 19).Alternatively, a combined register
in Form T.R. 22 may be maintained for watching all the undisbursed balances,
if it is considered more convenient (See Rule 432 (c)].

120. Receipts for money.—(a)  When a chalan in duplicate is received
with the money, the treasury shall use the original for the receipt to be given
to the payer and shall retain the duplicate for record. If there is a third copy
the  treasury  shall  forward  it  to  the  government  servant  or  other  person  to
whom the credit relates.

                                                                   73

PART  III

RULE  120

(b)  When a treasury receives a cheque under *[Rules 106(b) and
107(b),] the tenderer shall be given a preliminary acknowledgement in Form T.
R. 6 for the cheque only. A final receipt for the payment on the original chalan
shall be sent to the payer after the amount has been realized.

(c) When money is received on account of State Excise revenues,
the treasury shall receive with it only a single chalan countersigned by the
Excise  Inspector  or  any  higher  departmental  authority,  and  shall  give  the
payer a separate receipt in Form T.R. 14 and send a copy of it to the Excise
Inspector or higher departmental authority who has countersigned the chalan,
to serve as an advice. When any money is received on being tendered along
with a single chalan and a pass book or a remittance book, receipt shall be
acknowledged  in  the  pass  book  or  remittance  book.  When  any  money  is
received in payment for a cash order, no separate receipt need ordinarily be
given  as  the  cash  order  issued  in  exchange  for  the  moneys  is  a  sufficient
acknowledgment of the receipt of the money; if, however, the payer insists
on being given a separate receipt in any such case, he shall be required to
present a chalan in duplicate in Form T. R. 12 with the money and the treasury
shall give him a receipt on the original chalan.

(d)    When  the  fees  of  a  number  of  candidates  for  a  government
examination, e.g. the S.S.L.C. Examination, are paid into the treasury in a lump
sum, only a single receipt shall be given for the lump sum as a whole.

(e) For every payment made by cash or cheque for service postage
stamps issued by it, the treasury shall give a receipt in machine numbered
form T.R. 23.

**(f) The  receipts  for  money  paid  into  the  treasuries  shall  be

(g) Every treasury shall prominently exhibit notices in English and
the local language embodying the substance of clause (f) above one in the
room of the Treasurer or the Sub Treasury Officer, as the case may be, and one
near the Treasurer’s counter, in order that the persons who make payments
may verify that the receipts given to them satisfy the rule.

(h) Every  receipt  issued  by  a  treasury  shall  show  distinctly  the
name of the treasury, the date of issue, the designation of each government
servant who signs it and the head of account to which the amount has been
credited. Each signature on it shall be written legibly and in full.

NOTE 1.—Duplicate receipts.—The provisions of Rule 94 regarding the
issue of duplicate receipts apply to all government servants
including those attached to treasuries. With a view to avoiding
the misuse of duplicate chalan as a duplicate receipt, special
care  should  be  taken  to  see  that  the  treasury  officials
mentioned in Rule 120(f) sign in full only the copy or copies.
See  Rule  102(g)  of  the  chalan  to  be  returned  to  the  payer,
and merely initial the remaining copy or copies of the chalan.

*NOTE  2.—The  receipt  for  a  sum  paid  by  transfer  in  the  accounts  at
a district/sub treasury shall not be signed by the Treasurer.
All such receipts irrespective of the amount involved shall
be  signed  by  the  Section  Head/Head  Accountant/Junior
Superintendent  and  the  Accountant  concerned.  This
instruction does not apply to receipt for sums paid by transfer
in the accounts for service postage stamps (See note 3 below).

NOTE 3.—Payments for service postage stamps.—The treasury should
not give any receipt for a payment made for service postage
stamps  by  transfer  in  the  accounts.The  draft  receipt  for  a
payment made by cash or cheque for service postage stamps
should  always  be  sent  to  the  Sub  Treasury  Officer  at  a
sub-treasury  or  the Assistant  Treasury  Officer  at  a  district
treasury for signature through a government servant employed
in the treasury and not through any person from outside the
treasury. After  the  receipt  has  been  duly,  signed,  it  should
be  handed  over  together  with  the  service  postage  stamps
concerned  simultaneously  to  the  person  who  paid  the  cost
of  the  stamps  into  the  treasury.

any money into a civil court dealing with a treasury, which does not transact
its cash business through the Bank, should obtain from the court a chalan in
Form T.R. 24 and pay the money into the treasury along with it (See also Rule
96).

A  person  who  wishes  to  pay  any  money  into  a  court  dealing  with  a
treasury which does not transact its cash business through the Bank should
deliver the money along with the chalan and counterfoil receipt obtained from
the  court  to  the  treasury,  which  should  retain  the  chalan  and  return  the
counterfoil receipt duly signed. He should then take the receipt to the court,
which should enter the credit in its account and give the person who made the
payment a court receipt for the amount duly signed in exchange for the treasury
receipt, which the court should retain. The treasury receipt should, when filed
in the court, be attached by gum to the office counterfoil chalan.

NOTE—A District Judge or a Subordinate Judge may authorise his Sherishtadar
to sign chalans and a District Munsiff may authorise his Head Clerk
to do so. The chalan should bear a serial number, it should be duly
filled in at the court, and particulars of the notes and coin tendered
should be noted on the reverse. The counterfoil receipt should be
duly filled in at the court, except as to the date of payment into the
treasury and the signature of the Treasury Officer.

Treasury Officer shall send to each of the Divisional Forest Officer who deals with
the treasuries in his district a consolidated receipt in Form T.A. 11 in the Kerala
Account Code, Volume II, for the total amount received and credited under Forest
Remittances during the previous month in respect of the Forest Officer’s Division.
If any remittances relating to a Divisional Forest Officer have been received and
credited to Revenue deposits, the Treasury Officer shall enter in the consolidated
receipt the numbers assigned to the several deposits in the treasury [See also rule
129(b)]. As soon as the consolidated receipt is received from the treasury, it shall
be compared with the postings in the cash book and the Divisional Forest Officer
shall satisfy himself that the amounts remitted have been actually credited in the
treasury or the Bank.

                                                                   76

The Government servant whose duty is to examine the chalan shall do so and,
if it is in order, he shall specify the head of account, if it has not already been
done.

*NOTE—In the case of income tax chalan form, the Bank may return the
‘original’  copy  of  the  chalan  direct  to  the  Income  Tax  Officer
concerned, instead of routing it through the treasury.

RULES  124-125

NOTE  5.—Payments for stamps sold to the public by ex officio vendor
may be made direct to the ex officio vendors instead of the
Bank. At places where the treasury and the bank are closely
situated and it is, therefore, not inconvenient to follow the
procedure laid down in Rule 124 above, that procedure may
be  followed.

A government servant should pay for any service postage
stamps  for  which  he  indents  on  the  treasury  by  means  of
an  adjustment  bill  or  a  cheque  and  should  not  make  any
payment direct into the Bank on this account. The treasury
should not give any receipt for a payment made for service
postage  stamps  by  transfer  in  the  accounts.

Special to Judicial Department.—A person who wishes to pay
money  into  a  civil  court  dealing  with  a  treasury  which  transacts  its  cash
business  through  the  Bank  should  follow  the  same  procedure  as  that
prescribed in Rule 121 except that he should pay the money into the Bank
with a chalan in Form T.R. 26 together with a counterfoil receipt. The chalan
will be signed by the Bank Agent instead of the Treasury Officer. The chalan
and the counterfoil receipt need not be first presented at the treasury.

The procedure laid down in the second paragraph of rule 121 should be
followed  mutatis  mutandis  in  regard  to  the  issue  of  receipts  by  the  Bank
and the court concerned for such payments and filing of the Bank receipts in
the court.

Every civil court dealing with a treasury which transacts its cash business
through the Bank should maintain a register in Form T.A. 13 in the Kerala
Account Code, Volume II and make the necessary entries in it regarding all
moneys which private persons pay into the court as deposits with reference
to this instruction. Each deposit should be entered separately in the register
and numbered. There should be a fresh series of numbers for each year. The
Judge of the court should carefully check the particulars of each entry and
then write his initials against it in the proper column in token of its correctness.

NOTE—The procedure relating to the receipt of money in the High Court is
governed by the Original and Appellate Side Rules of the High Court
contained in the “Civil Rules of Practice”.

kind is send to the Bank from the treasury, the Treasury Officer shall send an
advice to the Currency Officer, Reserve Bank of India, Madras, on the same
day showing the amount and the date of despatch to the Bank. The Treasury
Officer shall debit the amount remitted in his accounts under the head “Cash
remittances - Reserve Bank of India”. If there are any sums of money of this
kind in the treasury on the same day fixed for the closing of the monthly
accounts, they shall be remitted to the Bank in full on that day, so that no cash
balance shall be shown against the treasury in the monthly accounts.

In order to ensure that every village remittance is duly credited in the
treasury, which transacts its cash business through the Bank, every treasury
concerned shall maintain a register in Form T.R. 27 and enter in it with a
serial  number  the  particulars  of  each  village  remittance  as  soon  as  it  is
tendered at the treasury. After the money in a village remittance has been duly
counted  and  tested  and  an  entry  of  the  receipt  made  in  the  day  book  or
subsidiary register, the Treasury Officer shall tick the entry in the register in
Form T.R. 27. When the money has been paid into treasury or the Bank and
the chalan has been received back from the treasury or Bank duly receipted,
the Treasury Officer shall write his initials in the last column of the register.

After  duly  counting  and  testing  the  money  tendered  in  a  village
remittance, the treasurer shall enter the receipt in his cash book. When closing
the treasury for the day, the Treasury Officer shall verify, by comparing the
Treasurer’s cash book with the village remittance register (Form T.R. 27), that
all the village remittance received have been brought to account.

NOTE 1.— Whenever  the  Bank  receives  a  remittance  sent  by  a  sub
treasury under the above rule, the Bank Agent should credit
the  amount  to  the  Government  under  the  head  “Cash
remittances-Reserve  Bank  of  India”  and  send  an  advice  of
the  receipt  of  the  remittance,  showing  the  amount  and  the
date of receipt, to the Currency Officer, Reserve Bank of India,
Madras  on  the  day  of  receipt,

NOTE  2.—In  the  case  of  treasuries  at  the  following  places,  village
remittances shall be paid direct to the Bank:-Cochin, Tellicherry,

PART  III

RULES  128-129

            The  procedure  to  be  followed  in  receiving  and  checking  these
remittances is laid down below:

(a) The Bank will make every effort to receive all village remittances
tendered before the closing hour and shroff and acknowledge them the same
day. If it receives a remittance, it will invariably complete the shroffing and
acknowledge the remittance the same day. If the Bank is unable to receive for
shroffing on the same day a remittance tendered shortly before its closing
hour, it will direct the village official who tenders it to return to the treasury
with the remittance and will give him a memorandum stating the time when the
remittance was tendered and the fact that the Bank is unable to receive it for
shroffing on the same day. The bags should then be sealed in the presence of
the village official and kept in the treasury strong room according to the usual
procedure and should be handed over to the village official to be tendered at
the Bank as soon as it reopens the next day.

(b) The Bank will give the village official who presents a  remittance
full facilities for watching the shroffing of it. If the Bank finds that there is a
shortage on account of bad or defective coins or otherwise, the village official
will be given an opportunity of making it good at once. If he does not do so,
the  Bank  will  inform  the  Treasury  Officer  and  the  Tahsildar  of  the  taluk
concerned  the  amount  and  nature  of  the  shortage,  and  will  credit  the
Government account only with the amount actually received by it.

129.

(a) When a treasury transacts its cash business through the Bank,
the treasury and not the Bank shall issue any advices or certificates of receipts
which have to be sent to public officers and the periodical consolidated receipts
which have to be sent to certain public officers, unless the Government, with the
concurrence of the Bank, specially order that in a particular class of cases this
shall be done by the Bank.

      (b) The Treasury Officer of a district treasury which transact its cash
business through the Bank shall send a monthly consolidated receipt to each of
the Divisional Forest Officers who deal with the treasuries in the district in the
manner laid down in Rule 122. He shall also follow the procedure laid down in Rule
123 in regard to signing the remittance books and consolidated receipts prepared
by Public Works Department Officers and Officers of Commercial Services at the
end of each month.

                                                                   82

If there is any difference between the book balance and the actual cash
balance  which  cannot  be  reconciled  at  once,  action  shall  be  taken  under
Article 315 in the Kerala Financial Code.

(b)

In an office in which there are no regular daily transactions or
the transactions are few, the head of the office may, with the previous approval
of  his  immediate  superior,  order  the  closing  of  the  cash  book  etc.,  less
frequently  than  every  day,  e.g.  once  a  week;  but  the  registers  should  be
closed and the cash balances verified often enough to prevent malpractices
and in no case less frequently than once a month.

(c) When  the  head  of  office  is  absent  on  tour  or  otherwise  the
Officer (Gazetted or non-gazetted) next below in rank and present shall discharge
all the duties of the head of office with regard to the maintenance of cash book
and verification of cash balance in accordance with the rules. The head of
office on his return, shall verify the correctness of the entries in the cash book
and  other  connected  records,  attest  them  and  verify  the  cash  balance  and
shall record a certificate to this effect in the cash book.

cash should maintain a small note book in Form T.R. 27-A in which the officer
in charge of money will enter items as he hands over money, cheques and
drafts to the last grade government servant messenger and obtain his signature
against the entry. The officer will similarly sign in the book when he receives
money from the messenger. For amounts handed over to the clerk, the latter’s
signature shall be taken and it shall be seen that these amounts are brought to
the cash book promptly.

RULES  133-134

SPECIAL TO THE FOREST DEPARTMENT

133. Verification  of  monthly  closing  cash  balance.—Each  Divisional
Forest Officer should verify in person his monthly closing cash balance as at the
close  of  business  on  the  last  day  of  each  month  and  append  a  certificate  of
verification to the monthly classified abstract of cash account

.If, however, a Divisional Forest Officer is absent on tour when his monthly
closing cash balance has to be verified and certified, or is so incapacitated by
sickness that, it is physically impossible for him to attend to these duties, the
senior  subordinate  Forest  Officer  present  at  the  Divisional  Forest  Officer’s
headquarters (excluding the Head Clerk and other office employees) should do
so, but in that case the fact of the Divisional Forest Officer’s absence or sickness
should be distinctly noted in the return. Except with the special permission of the
Chief Conservator of Forests on each occasion, a Divisional Forest Officer should
not allow more than two consecutive months to elapse without personally verifying
his monthly closing cash balance. The result of each verification of the monthly
closing cash balance should be reported to the Accountant General.

SPECIAL  TO  THE  PUBLIC  WORKS  DEPARTMENT

134. Verification of monthly closing cash balance.—The actual balance
in the cash chest of each office should be counted on the last working day of each
month immediately after closing the cash account of the month or, if this is not
possible,  at  least  on  the  morning  of  the  next  working  day  before  any  further
transactions  take  place. A  statement  of  the  details  of  the  actual  cash  balance
should be prepared in the prescribed form. A certificate of verification specifying
the actual cash balance (exclusive of imprests and temporary advances) both in
words  and  figures  and  stating  that  it  was  ascertained  by  actual  counting  by
himself should be recorded below the closing entries in the cash book and signed
and dated by the disbursing officer.

When it is impossible for the disbursing officer, owing to absence from
headquarters  or  illness,  to  count  the  cash  balance  on  the  prescribed  date,  he
should do so at the earliest opportunity and record the reason for the delay on the
cash balance report [Form No. 5, Book of Form (P.W. Accounts)].

A. CUSOTDY  OF  TREASURY  CASH  BALANCES

(i)   District Treasuries

135. Custody and verification of the treasury balance.—

(a) The bulk of the treasury cash balance, generally known as the
“main store” or the double lock balance, shall be kept in the treasury strong
room under double locks. The Treasury Officer shall hold the key of one of the
two  padlocks  placed  on  the  entrance  to  the  double  lock  strong  room  of  a
district treasury and the Chief Treasurer, the key of the other.

The Treasury Officer and the Chief Treasurer shall both be present in
person whenever the double lock strong room is opened and shall remain
there till it is closed. When opening the strong room, the Treasury Officer and
the Chief Treasurer respectively shall himself unlock the padlock of which he
holds the key and immediately remove the key, similarly, when closing it, each
shall himself lock the padlock of which he holds the key. When closing the
strong room, each double lock officer shall satisfy himself that each double
lock receptacle has been double locked and that no one remains inside the
strong room; the entrance to the strong room shall then be closed and double
locked, and each double lock officer shall satisfy himself that this has been
properly done.

When  the  strong  room  is  finally  closed  for  the  day,  the  Treasury
Officer and the Chief Treasurer respectively shall, after locking the padlock on
the entrance to the strong room of which he holds the key, place the key in a
leather bag and have the bag sealed in the presence of both the officers by a
subordinate, who shall not take the key out of the bag. Both the official seal
and the private seal of the Treasury Officer shall be affixed to each of the bags.
Each double lock officer shall take his bag from the subordinate immediately
after it has been sealed. Both the seals shall then be affixed to each of the two
padlocks on the entrance to the strong room and each double lock officer
shall satisfy himself that this has been properly done before he leaves the
place.

The Treasury Officer and the Chief  Treasurer respectively shall never,
under any circumstances, hand over the key held by him to anyone other than
a government servant who has been duly authorized to take charge of the
duties of his post from him.

(For the corresponding rule for a sub treasury, see Rules 140 and 141)

PART  IV

RULE  135

(b) The Treasurer may be allowed to hold in his separate custody a
sum sufficient for the convenient transaction of Government business. The
Treasury Officer shall see that the amount so held does not ordinarily exceed
` 5,000 and that any request by the Treasurer for a larger sum is carefully
scrutinized taking into consideration the cash receipts of the day which may
also be utilised for the expenditure for the day. Before signing the Treasurer’s
daily balance sheet when closing the treasury for the day, the Treasury Officer
shall verify the balance in the Treasurer’s sole charge as shown in that sheet
and satisfy himself that it does not exceed the current requirements, that it
contains no uncurrent coin and that it does not contain more of any kind of
small coin than is needed for current use. He shall also verify that the total
value of the cash, stamps, opium, gunja and banderols held in the Treasurer’s
sole  charge  does  not  exceed  the  amount  of  the  security  furnished  by  the
Treasurer, and shall then have them placed in the double lock strong room.

NOTE   1.—Treasury balance and currency chest balance.—The moneys
held in a treasury as part of the Government’s cash balance
form  the  treasury  balance,  from  which  Government
disbursements are made and into which Government receipts
are  paid. A  separate  currency  chest  also  is  ordinarily  kept
in  the  treasury. The  currency  chest  balance  consists  partly
of notes which are treated as not “in circulation” and partly
of  coin  (rupees  and  gold  coin)  which  is  part  of  the  assets
held by the Issue Department of the Reserve Bank of India
against  the  note  issued  in  accordance  with  the  provisions
of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (India Act II of 1934).
The  contents  of  the  currency  chest  are  the  property  of  the
Reserve  Bank  but  the  Government  are  responsible  to  the
Reserve  Bank,  for  them.  All  the  government  servants
concerned should take the same care to safeguard the currency
chest  balances  as  in  the  case  of  the  treasury  balance.

NOTE   2.—Deposit in currency chest of sealed bag of coin or bundle
of  notes  relating  to  a  loss  of  cash  from  the  currency  chest
or the treasury balance.—In cases of losses of money due
to theft from currency chests, the amount recovered is sealed
in  a  packet  or  bag  and  deposited  into  the  currency  chest.
When  the  loss  is  due  to  defalcation,  the  deficient  bags  or
bundles, from which money has been removed, are also kept

                                                                   87

RULE  135

sealed  in  the  currency  chest.  When  it  becomes  necessary
to take out the sealed packet and/or bag or deficient bag and/
or bundle for exhibition in court, the transaction should be
treated  as  a  definite  withdrawal  from  the  chest  on  the  day
of withdrawal and included in the advice and currency chest
slip to be sent on that day to the Currency Officer, Madras.
Similarly, when these are deposited into the currency chest
(which should be done as soon as possible), the transactions
should  be  treated  as  a  deposit  into  the  currency  chest  and
included in the transactions of the day and in the chest slip
to  be  sent  to  the  Currency  Officer,  Madras.

Whenever  a  sealed  packet  of  notes  or  bag  of  coins
is deposited into the currency chest, there should be a clear
certificate attached to the packet or bag as the case may be,
in  the  handwriting  of  and  over  the  full  signature  with  the
date and designation of the officer whose private seal is affixed
on  it,  stating  the  contents  and  value  of  the  sealed  packet
or bag. The certifying officer should be someone other than
the  officer-in-charge  of  the  treasury  or  sub  treasury  and
should be either the Magistrate who is dealing with the case
in question or an officer of the Revenue Department not below
the rank of a Revenue Divisional Officer. In respect of a bag
so sealed and till the case is finally disposed of, there is no
need  to  break  open  the  seal  every  time  the  currency  chest
has to be verified. The officer verifying the currency chest
balance  should  accept  the  certificate  so  long  as  the  seal  is
intact and include the amount in the balance. When the case
is over and the sealed bag is no longer required for production
in a court of law, the usual procedure for making up the notes
into bundles or coins into bags and for verifying their contents
should  be  followed.

The above instructPART IVions apply also to cases of losses
from the treasury balance. If, for any specially strong reason,
the  Magistrate  finds  it  necessary  to  seal  the  bags  the
following  procedure  should  be  observed:—
If the sealed bags do not contain any small coin and contain
only  rupee  coin  or  notes  in  even  hundreds  of  rupees,  the
sealed bags should be deposited into the currency chest and

                                                                   88

PART  IV

RULES  135-136

an equivalent amount taken out from it in exchange for the
contents of the sealed bags. Whenever a need arises for taking
the sealed bags out of the currency chest for production in
court, the transaction should be treated as a definite withdrawal
on  the  day  of  taking  them  out  and  included  in  the  advice
and currency chest slip to be sent for that day to the Currency
Officer, Madras. Similarly, when sealed bags are replaced in
the  currency  chest,  the  transaction  should  be  treated  as  a
deposit  into  the  chest  and  included  in  the  transactions  of
the day and in the chest slip to be sent to the Currency Office,
Madras.
If, however, the sealed bags contain small coin or amounts
which  are  not  in  even  hundreds  of  rupees,  such  exchange
from  the  currency  chest  is  not  permissible.  Once  a  bag  is
sealed by the court as an exhibit in a case, the contents of
the bag cannot be taken out for treasury disbursements till
the  case  is  closed.  Such  sealed  bags  which  cannot  be
deposited in the currency chest should be accounted for as
valuable property in the Safe Custody Register Form T.R. 28
until the final disposal of the case, i.e., they should be excluded
from  the  treasury  balance  by  making  a  debit  to  the  head
“Suspense-Payments in Cash”, which will be cleared on the
close  of  the  case.    Each  issue  of  the  sealed  bag  from  the
treasury for production in court and receipt of the bag back
from  the  court  should  be  noted  in  red  ink  in  the  register
mentioned  above.

136. Treasury strong room.—

(a) No place should be used as a strong-room, unless an officer of
the Public Works Department not lower in rank than an Executive Engineer
has  certified  that  it  is  secure  and  fit  for  use  as  a  strong  room.  He  should
examine particularly the condition of any part of the enclosing walls which
is not, on the outside, under the observation of the guard. When giving his
certificate, he should prescribe any conditions that may be necessary as to
the manner of storing the coin e.g., that it should not be piled on trestles but
should  be  kept  in  boxes,  or  that  no  bag  or  box  should  be  placed  within  a
prescribed distance of the wall or in any particular part of the room.

(b) An iron safe used in the strong room should be embedded in
masonry, so that the handles of the lid just reach the ground level. Locks and
bolts should be kept well oiled and free from dust.

                                                                   89

(c) Every  strong  room  should  be  inspected  annually  by  the
Executive Engineer or by an experienced Assistant Engineer or an officer
holding  sub  divisional  charge  deputed  by  the  Executive  Engineer  for  the
purpose and the Treasury Officer should obtain a certificate of safety from the
Inspecting Officer after each annual inspection.

(d) The Superintendent of Police should record an order prescribing
the positions of the sentries, and may require any additional precautions to be
taken in regard to the strengthening of fastenings, burning of lights, etc. The
responsibility for the security of the building and its fixtures will, however,
remain with the Executive Engineer, and the responsibility for the security of
chests and other treasury furniture not forming part of the building or fixtures
will remain with the Treasury Officer.

(e) A copy of the latest certificate given by an Inspecting Public
Works  Officer  under  clause  (c)  above  and  a  copy  of  the  order  of  the
Superintendent  of  Police  under  clause  (d)  above  should  be  hung  up  in  a
conspicuous place inside the strong room. The Treasury Officer should see
that any conditions as to the manner of storage of treasure mentioned in these
documents are complied with.

(f) The  doors  and  windows  of  the  strong  room  should  be  kept
permanently closed and locked, except during the time necessary for moving
coin  or  other  valuables  into  or  out  of  it. As  an  exception  to  this  rule,  the
opening of shutters is permitted during office hours in an aperture, which is
otherwise barred, if it is necessary for the admission of light or air to any
other part of the building, provided that all coins and valuables remain securely
packed in locked receptacles.

(g) Chubbs, Hobbs, Godrej or Dindigul Padlocks or Sparling patent
padlocks manufactured at the Sparling Lock Works at Aligarh should be used
as the double locks on the entrance to a strong room, and also on double lock
receptacles kept in the strong room.

137. Treasury padlocks and keys.—

(a) A register of all the padlocks and keys belonging to the district
treasury  and  its  sub  treasuries  should  be  maintained  in  Form T.R.  29  and
kept  in  the  strong  room  of  the  district  treasury.  Separate  pages  should  be
assigned to the district treasury and to each sub treasury. Each sub treasury
should  also  keep  a  list  of  its  own  padlocks  and  keys  in  the  same  form.

                                                                   90

RULE  137

*The Treasury Officer or the Treasurer, as the case may be, shall initial in column
9 of the register against each original key in his charge as an acknowledgment that
he has received it. In regard to each duplicate key, which is kept in the box of
duplicate keys under the joint custody of the Treasury Officer and the Treasurer,
a note shall be made to that effect and initialed by the Treasury Officer and the
Treasurer in column 7 of the register. The Treasury Officer shall note the number
and date of safe custody deposit item of the sealed box containing the duplicate
keys of the padlocks used on the entrance of the district treasury strong room,
etc., [See clause (e) below] in the appropriate place of the register. The Treasury
Officer shall obtain the acknowledgment from each Sub Treasury Officer for the
original Sub Treasury keys in his possession and the number and date of each
acknowledgement shall be noted in the register.

All padlocked boxes, locks and keys used for remittance purposes are
the property of the Reserve Bank which will be responsible for repairs to, and
replacements  of,  such  boxes,  locks,  keys,  etc. All Treasury  Officers  and  Sub
Treasury Officers should maintain a separate account of all such articles in their
custody in the form prescribed by the Reserve Bank. The boxes should be marked
“R.B.M.” and used for remittance purposes, when necessary. Any charges for
repair or replacement of these boxes, locks and keys should be incurred only with
the previous sanction of the Currency Officer and debited to the Reserve Bank.

(b) Every padlock should have a number impressed upon it or attached
to it by a metal or other label, and the same number should be impressed on, or
attached to each key belonging to it. No two padlocks in the same district should
bear the same number.

(c) Whenever  a  padlock  is  out  of  order  or  no  longer  required  the
Treasury Officer should sent it to the Superintendent, Public Works Department,
Engineering Workshop, Trivandrum for repairs or for disposal. If a key is lost, the
Treasury Officer should at once report the fact to the Director of Treasuries and
send the padlock to the Superintendent, Public Works Department, Engineering
Work shop, Trivandrum, requesting him to have its lever altered and provide new
keys for it. If the key lost is the property of the Reserve Bank, the loss should be
reported to the Bank. No padlock of which a key has been lost may be used again
in the districts, until it has been so altered. The Treasury Officer should ordinarily
recover the cost of the alteration and the new keys from the person or persons to
whose carelessness he attributes the loss of the key.No local mechanic may ever
be allowed to repair a treasury padlock or to make a new key for one.

(d) No spare padlocks should be kept at a sub treasury or except

with the permissions of the Director of Treasuries at a district treasury.

The Director of Treasuries should see that no necessary padlock and
keys and no unnecessary duplicate keys are supplied to, or retained in any
treasury. No duplicate keys should be kept at a sub treasury.

(e) All spare padlocks with their keys which are kept in a District
Treasury with the approval of the Director of Treasuries and all duplicate keys
pertaining  to  the  District  Treasury  and  the  Sub  Treasuries  in  the  District,
except  the  duplicate  keys  of  the  locks  used  in  the  entrance  to  the  strong
room of the District Treasury and the District Stamp Depot if any and that of
the  duplicate  key  receptacle  shall  be  kept  in  the  District  Treasury  strong
room  in  a  receptacle  with  double  locks  as  an  item  of  deposit  under  safe
custody. The key of one of the locks of this duplicate key receptacle shall be
kept  with  the  District  Treasury  Officer  and  the  key  of  the  other  with  the
Treasurer. The District Treasury Officer and the Treasurer shall keep these
keys in their personal custody and shall not hand them over to any one except
under the written orders of the Director of Treasuries. But the District Treasury
Officer shall hand over the keys in his possession to the Assistant Treasury
Officer/Officer-in-charge of the District Stamp Depot if any, when he is absent
from headquarters on account of tour or inspection work or otherwise. The
District Treasury Officer may also authorise another Treasurer of the District
Treasury to keep the key in the custody of the Treasurer present when the
regular Treasurer is absent on leave or for some other valid reasons.

(f) The District Treasury Officer shall, in the presence of the Treasurer-
in-charge of the keys of the strong room of the District Treasury put the duplicate
keys of the locks used on the entrance of the District Treasury strong room as well
as those of the locks of the entrance door of the strong room of the District Stamp
Depot, if any, and those duplicate keys of two locks used on the duplicate key
receptacle referred to in sub-rule (e) in a box having double lock arrangement and
fitted with chubbs, hobbs, godrej or dindigul padlock or sparling patent padlocks
and keep one key of the lock of the box, with himself and one key of the other lock
being kept by the Treasurer; the duplicate keys being kept in duplicate receptacle.
The box shall then be wrapped and tied around by means of a tape or thread. The
Treasury Officer and the Treasurer shall affix their seals on the tape or thread in
such a way that the wrapper cannot be opened without tampering with the seals.
The District Treasury Officer shall then deposit the box in the nearest branch of

the State Bank of India/State Bank of Travancore.  The District Treasury Officer
and the Treasurer shall keep their respective keys of the box in their personal
custody and shall never under any circumstances hand over the key held by them
to any one other than a government servant who has been duly authorised to take
charge of the duties of their respective posts from them. Once in a year, in April,
the District Treasury Officer shall take back the box from the Bank and open the
safe in the presence of a Treasurer, examine the keys, lock the box and seal it again
in the aforesaid manner and return it to the appointed person. He should also
make a note at the same time in the register of padlocks and keys stating that the
keys were examined by him and the Treasurer found them to be correct under
attestation by both.

(g) Whenever  the  Collector,  or  the  Treasury  Officer  hands  over
charge, all padlocks and duplicate keys belonging to or kept in the treasury
should be examined and compared with the register of padlocks, and keys
and the relieving officer should sign a certificate in the register showing whether
he has found them to be correct. The padlocks and duplicate keys need not,
however, be examined when the Collector or the Treasury Officer is transferred
only temporarily or goes on casual leave and the temporary incumbent is not
likely to have any occasion to open the receptacle containing spare padlocks
and duplicate keys. If it becomes necessary for the temporary incumbent to
do so whilst in charge, he should at once carry out the examination of all
padlocks and duplicate keys and sign a certificate in the register as prescribed
above.

*In sub rule (g) for the words “The Collector or the Treasury Officer”
in both the places where they occur, the words “The Treasury Officer or the
Treasurer” shall be substituted.

Whenever either of the two government servants who hold the two
sets of keys of the double locks in use at a sub treasury hands over charge
otherwise than temporarily, all the padlocks and keys in use in the sub treasury
should be checked with the register of padlocks and keys and the relieving
government servant should sign a certificate showing whether he has found
them to be correct.

(h) Whenever  an  officer  of  the  Indian  Audit  and  Accounts
Department inspects a treasury, he will report whether the rule prescribed by
the  government  for  the  custody  of  the  padlocks  and  keys  of  the  treasury
strong room and chest are duly observed.

RULES  137-138

Whenever the Director or one of his assistants inspects a sub treasury,
he should check all the padlocks and keys in use in the sub Treasury with the
register of padlocks and keys and record the result in the register. The Assistant
should also report the result of his check to the Director.

(i) The  Director  of  Treasuries  may  modify  these  instructions  in
matters of detail to suit local convenience, when necessary, but there should
be no departure from the essential instructions relating to important matters,
such as the responsibility for the custody, of duplicate keys, the examination
of duplicate keys periodically and when there is a transfer of charge, and the
report to be made when the key is lost.

138.

Storage of treasure.—

(a) Coin shall be stored in a strong room in one of the following
three ways.—(i) In bags of uniform size and contents placed in strong iron
boxes or safes, or wooden chests, or built recesses or wells, each of which
shall have two independent locks and be so constructed that it is impossible
to have any access to the contents until both locks have been opened. Bags
made  of  net  material  shall  always  be  used  for  storing  whole  rupees.  The
Treasury Officer shall hold the key of one of the two locks on each double
lock receptacle in a district treasury and the Treasurer, the keys of the other.
The Treasury Officer and the Treasurer respectively shall never, under any
circumstance, hand over any double lock key held by him to any one other
than a government servant who has been duly authorised to take charge of
the duties of his post from him.

(For the corresponding rule for a sub treasury, See Rule 140).

(ii)

 In bags of uniform size and contents piled upon trestles. Bags
made  of  net  material  shall  always  be  used  for  storing  whole  rupees.  This
method  must  not  be  adopted  unless  every  door,  window,  drain,  sky-light,
ventilator, or other aperture in the walls or ceiling of the strong room is so
closed, as to make it impossible to insert any rod or instrument into the strong
room.

(iii) Temporarily in preparation for making a remittance, in stout
boxes capable of containing  ` 4,000 to  `  6,000 each, nailed down and bound
with  iron,  without  gunny  covering  or  ropes.  The  iron  hoops  on  each  box
should be rivetted or nailed together where they cross. Each box should bear
a number and the name of the despatching treasury cut into or painted on it.

                                                                   94

PART  IV

RULES  138-139

(b) All notes shall be stored in separate receptacles and not along
with coin. High value notes shall be stored in a tin box, and the remaining
notes  in  suitable  receptacle  that  will  protect  them  from  injury  by  damp,
insects, etc. They shall be kept in bundles of not more than a hundred notes,
each, and each bundle shall contain notes of one denomination only.

Explanation.—Notes of the denomination of  ` 100 or more shall

be treated as high value notes.
NOTE—Nottams should not be placed in charge of the keys of the treasury
nor  should  they  be  made  to  keep  any  accounts  other  than  those
pertaining to the Nottams. They should be liable only for bad coins
received and over payments made by them during the day. A Treasurer
going  on  casual  leave  should  hand  over  his  key  to  an Assistant
Treasurer (if there is such a post in the treasury). If there is no post
of Assistant Treasurer, the Treasurer going on casual leave should
hand over his keys to another government servant employed in the
treasury (who may be either an Accountant or a Nottam) as nominated
by him on the clear understanding that the responsibility in the event
of  loss  during  the  period  of  charge  of  such  nominee  rests  on  the
Treasurer.

139. Receipt of moneys into and issue of moneys from double locks.—

The following procedure shall be followed:—

(a) Coin of each denomination shall be made up in bags of uniform size
and contents by the Treasurer for reception into the double locks. The Treasury
Officer shall verify the contents of each bag, and shall then count the bags into
the double lock receptacle.

(b) Notes intended for delivery into double locks shall be made up in
bundles according to denomination in the order of receipt. No bundle shall contain
more than a hundred notes. The Treasury Officer shall count the notes in each
bundle with his own hands and satisfy himself that it does not contain any note
of a denomination different from that specified on the label in Form T.R. 31 affixed
on top of the bundle, and shall sign the label as a token of his verification. He shall
then count the bundles so verified into the tin box containing high value notes or
the double lock receptacle with his own hands and, if the tin box has been taken
out of the double lock receptacle shall replace it therein with his own hands.

The detailed check of fresh notes of the denomination of  ` 10 and  `  5
received in a remittance from the Currency Office may be confined to one bundle
in every ten taken at random.

                                                                   95

PART  IV

RULE  139

(c) Notes shall be given out of double locks by counting the number
of bundles. The bundles shall be arranged in the double lock receptacle in the
order of receipt and given out in the same order, taking first those which were
received  earliest,  so  that  notes  of  the  older  issues  shall  not  be  stored
indefinitely. As soon as the Treasury Officer and the Treasurer have opened
a double lock receptacle for the purpose of taking out notes, the Treasury
Officer shall take out with his own hands the requisite bundles of notes (or,
if it is required, the tin box containing the high value notes) and the receptacle
shall  immediately  be  closed. The Treasury  Officer  shall  take  out  with  his
own hands all notes that have not be taken out of the tin box containing high
value notes and, during any period required for counting the notes, the tin
box shall be kept closed. As soon as the transaction relating to the notes kept
in the tin box has been completed, the Treasury Officer shall replace it in the
appropriate double lock receptacle with his own hands.

(d) A double lock receptacle shall not be kept open or unlocked
for longer than is necessary and in no circumstances shall more than one
double  lock  receptacle  be  kept  unlocked  at  a  time.  As  soon  as  the
transaction relating to a receptacle has been completed, it shall be properly
double locked.

(e) The  provisions  in  clauses  (b)  and  (c)  above  requiring  the
Treasury Officer to take out notes from double lock receptacles with his own
hands and to count them himself in no way affect the responsibility of the
Treasurer for the handling of the moneys in the treasury as laid down in Rule
135.

(f) A memorandum in Form T.R. 32 for coin, or one in Form T.R. 33
for notes, shall be kept in each double lock receptacle showing its contents.
Whenever any amount is passed into or out of double locks, the Treasury
Officer shall make the necessary entries in these memoranda and in Form T.R.
4 (Treasurer’s Daily Balance Sheet) at the time with his own hands.

(g) When notes are prepared in accordance with clause (b) above
for reception into double locks, a slip in Form T.R. 31 stating the number of
notes  the  bundle  contains  and  their  denomination,  and  bearing  the  full
signature  of  the  government  servant  who  made  up  the  bundle  and  the
government servant who last counted the notes in it shall invariably be affixed
to the top of each bundle, so that if any deficiency or defect of any kind is
detected subsequently, there may be no uncertainty as to who counted and
examined the notes. A slip in Form T.R. 30 shall be duly filled up and placed in
each bag of coin which is prepared for reception into double locks.

                                                                   96

rest with the Sub Treasury Officer in the case of sub treasuries.

141. The amount of cash required for current purposes to be left in the
custody of the Treasurer in a sub treasury shall be fixed by the District Treasury
Officer and such cash should be kept by the Treasurer under single lock in the
strong  room.  If  on  account  of  the  receipt,  the  amount  in  the  hands  of  the
Treasurer becomes larger than the maximum fixed by the District Treasury
Officer he shall at once inform the Sub Treasury Officer or other officer-in-
charge of the sub treasury so that the latter may transfer the excess to the
main sub treasury balance under double locks.

Verification and Certification of Cash Balance of Treasuries

144. The monthly cash balance in the treasury, i.e., the cash balance at
the close of the day on which the accounts of the month are closed, shall be
verified as follows:—

(a) Copper,  bronze  and  nickel  coin.—The  Collector  or  other
verifying government servant shall adopt such method of verification as he
thinks  satisfactory,  remembering  that  he  is  personally  responsible  for  the
correctness of the balance stated by him. He shall always count the number of
bags at the time of verification, and shall examine their contents at frequent
intervals, though it is not essential to do so every month.

                                                                   97

(b) Notes.—(i) The verifying government servant shall personally

examine and count all notes of *denominations above  ` 100.

(ii) The following method shall be adopted for verifying notes of
other denominations, if the verifying government servant cannot count them
personally without undue inconvenience:—

The notes shall be kept in bundles of a certain marked number. In
each bundle a few notes at the top shall be folded back and the rest counted
by clerks or assistants, who are not persons responsible for the correctness
of the bundles. The verifying government servant shall then see whether the
addition of the notes folded back to the number already counted makes up the
total number marked on the bundle.

The verifying government servant shall also satisfy himself that the
notes in each bundle are all of the alleged value, e.g., that a five rupee note is
not counted as one of a bundle of ten rupee notes.

145. These rules shall be printed and pasted on a board and hung up in

the strong room in a conspicuous place.

146. The  Collector  or  other  government  servant  who  verifies  the
monthly cash balance in the treasury shall certify to the balance in the District
Treasury Cash Balance Report (Form T.R. 39) in the following form:—

“I hereby certify that I have personally ascertained by counting, that the
balance in the district treasury, for which I am responsible, amounted on the
…………………………………………..…….…….  to      `…………….
(in words) …………………………………………………………. I further
certify  that  the  bulk  of  the  treasure  is  kept  under  double  locks  the  key  of
one of which is in the exclusive custody of the Treasury Officer and that of the
other with the Treasurer. I further certify that the balance under single lock
with the Treasurer amounted on the above date to  ` ………………….. and
that at no time did the Treasurer hold in his separate custody a sum larger than
was necessary for the convenient transaction of Government business or a
sum which, together with the value of stamps, opium, etc., in his sole custody,
was larger than the security given by him.

147. When the cash balance is verified on any date other than the first
working day of a month, it should be verified in the manner prescribed in Rule
144 above and the balance should be reported to the Government in the Finance
Department, and to the Accountant General in the usual form of cash balance
report (Form T.R. 35) (vide also Rule 311).

RULES  147-148

This  provision  regarding  reports  does  not  apply  to  the  reports  of  the
verification  of  the  cash  balance  on  account  of  a  transfer  of  charge;  they
should be sent in accordance with Treasury Rule 4(4) of Part I and Rule 52 of
Part II.

The provisions of Rules 142, 143 and 145 are applicable to the verification

of sub treasury balances also.

148. The Sub Treasury Officer or other government servant who verifies
the monthly closing cash balance of the sub treasury shall sign a certificate as
follows on the sub treasury cash balance report (Form T.R. 36):

“I hereby certify that the balance in the sub treasury amounted on the
……………...........................………. to  Rupees …………………….. and that I
have personally examined and ascertained that the said balance was actually
in the said sub treasury had agreed with the details of notes and coins entered
above.”

NOTE  1.—When verifying the stamps kept under double locks, it will
be sufficient for the Sub Treasury Officer or other government
servant  who  verifies  the  cash  balance  personally  to  check
10  per  cent  of  the  stock  in  each  class  of  stamps  and  to
supervise the checking of the remaining stock in each class
by a reliable subordinate. The clerk who maintains the stamp
accounts and the Treasurers, Gollahs and Peons working in
the  sub  treasury  office  should  not  be  allowed  to  assist  in
verifying  the  stamps.  The  result  of  the  verification  should
be recorded in the stock register of stamps and attested by
all the government servants who are required to be present
during  the  verification.

NOTE    2.—A  sub  treasury  which  transacts  its  cash  business  through
the  Bank  should  have  no  cash  balance  at  the  close  of  any
accounts  month,  and  any  cash  in  hand  on  the  last  day  of
the accounts month should be remitted into the Bank on the
same  day  without  fail.

RULES  148-149

NOTE  3.—Whenever the whole balance under double lock is verified,
a certificate of verification should be entered in the Treasurer’s
daily balance sheet. The fact of verification of the contents
of  each  double  lock  chest  should  also  be  noted  in  the
memorandum  kept  in  the  chest,  whenever  the  contents  are
verified.

SECTION IV

Currency Chest Balances

LOCATION  OF  CURRENCY  CHESTS

149. Unless in any case the Government after consultation with the
Reserve Bank of India direct otherwise, permanent currency chests should be
maintained at all treasuries and sub treasuries where the transactions are of
such a magnitude that the additional facility for the transfer of funds thus
afforded reduces appreciably the locking up of moneys or the frequency of
remittances of coins and notes. At sub treasuries where a permanent currency
chest  is  not  maintained,  temporary  chests  for  period  not  exceeding  six
months may be opened during the revenue collecting season, in order that the
money  collected  at  the  sub  treasury  may  be  available  at  once  for  transfer
through currency.  Treasury  Officers  are  authorized  to  open temporary
chests at sub treasuries when required, but they should report the opening of
each  chest  and  the  amount  of  the  first  deposit  into  it  by  telegram  to  the
Currency  Officer.

Explanation.—Under the provisions of the Reserve Bank of India Act,
the  amount  of  currency  and  bank  notes  in  circulation,
which constitute the liabilities of the Issue Department
of  the  Bank,  should  not  exceed  the  assets  of  that
department held in gold, sterling securities, rupee coin
(including rupee notes), and rupee securities. A portion
of  these  assets  is  held  in  the  various  currency  chests
in the form of rupee coin and rupee notes. The currency
and  bank  notes  held  in  these  chests  are  notes  in
circulation but pass into circulation only when they are
transferred to the treasury balances. Assuming that there
are  no  transactions  elsewhere,  the  deposit  of  currency
and bank notes in a currency chest decreases the amount

and  rupee  notes  inthe  chest  increase  the  assets  of  the
Issue Department of the Bank. A deposit notes or coin
in a currency chest thus enables the Bank to issue notes
elsewhere    upto    the      amount      deposited  without
increasing the total amount of the notes in circulation.
If, therefore, a transfer of funds from the treasury balance
at ‘A’ to the treasury balance at ‘B’ is required, this can
be  effected  at  short  notice  and  without  the  actual
remittance of coin or notes by transferring money from
the  treasury  balance  to  the  currency  chest  at  ‘A’  and
transferring  the  same  amount  from  them  enables  the
treasury balance at a treasury or sub treasury to be kept
at a low figure, as it is always possible to replenish the
balance quickly by a transfer of money from the currency
chest.  It  also  obviates  the  necessity  for  frequent
remittances  of  coins  and  notes,  as  surplus  funds  can
always be deposited into the currency chests and made
available  for  use  elsewhere,  pending  a  convenient
occasion for remittance.

NOTE   1.—At places where the cash business of the treasury is conducted
by the Bank, the currency chests are kept in the sole custody
of  the  Bank.

NOTE  2.—The Currency Officer will be responsible for maintaining the
required form of currency chests. It is the duty of the Treasury
Officers  to  see  that  currency  chests  at  district  and  sub
treasuries  are  adequately  stocked  with  notes  and  rupees  to
meet  all  reasonable  demands  for  change.

CUSTODY

150. At a treasury which does not transact its cash business through
the bank, an entirely separate receptacle or receptacles should be set apart for
the contents of the currency chest and kept under double locks. The keys of
these  double  locks  should  be  held  in  the  same  manner  as  the  keys  of  the
double locks placed on receptacles used for the double lock treasury balance—
See Rules 136 (a) (i) and 138.

                                                                   101

PART  IV

RULES  151-152

151. The  notes  and  coin  held  in  the  currency  chest  should  be  kept
quite distinct from the treasury balances and should not be touched, except in
accordance with the rules contained in this Code or the instructions of the
Currency Officer, Reserve Bank of India, Madras. The procedure described in
Rule 139 for receiving moneys into, and issuing moneys from, double locks
should be followed in making deposits in or withdrawals from, the currency
chest.

152. The following instructions apply to all currency chests for which

the Government are responsible:—

(i) Every transaction should be in even hundreds of rupees.
(ii) Copper, bronze and nickel coins should never be deposited in

the  chest.

(iii) A currency chest book in Form T.R. 37 should be kept in the
chest  and  the  balance  entered  in  the  book,  proved  and  signed  at  every
transaction by the officials in joint charge of the chest. They should satisfy
themselves that the transaction has correctly entered and that the balances
have been correctly calculated. They should invariably see that the currency
chest book is found within the chest when it is opened, that it is replaced in
the chest as soon as each transaction has been completed and the entry in the
book signed, and that the chest is then properly double locked at once.

NOTE  1.—For the purpose of “proving” the currency chest balance as
contemplated above at every transaction involving an addition
to or subtraction from the contents of the chest, the number
of  bundles  of  notes  and  bags  of  coin  under  the  various
denominations and any loose amounts less than a full bundle
or bag should be counted and tallied with the currency chest
book. It is not necessary for this purpose to verify in detail
by  actual  counting  all  the  coin  and  notes  in  the  chest.

NOTE  2.—A currency chest book should be retained for three complete

financial  years  after  it  ceases  to  be  in  use.

(iv) The officials in charge of the currency chest may deposit notes in
it in exchange for coin or notes of other denominations, or coin in exchange for
notes. These exchanges should not ordinarily be of small sums and they should
be avoided, as far as possible, during the  last  week of  the  month.  If  important
exchanges are made during the last three days of the month, the transactions
should be telegraphed to the Currency Officer.

                                                                   102

RULES  152-153

(v) On every day on which the chest is opened, a serially numbered
currency chest slip in Form T.R. 38 should be prepared, signed by the two
government servant in charge of the currency chest and sent to the Currency
Officer,  Madras,  when  the  treasury  is  closed  for  the  day.  Further  detailed
instructions regarding currency chest transactions and currency chest slips
contained in Appendix 7 should also be followed.

VERIFICATION  OF  CURERNCY  CHEST  BALANCES

153.

(i) The Reserve Bank of India will conduct through its own officers
the verification of the balance in a chest in the sole custody of the Bank in
such manner as its considers desirable.

(ii) The balance in the currency chest at a district treasury which
does not transact its cash business through the Bank should be verified at the
close of each month by the Government Servant who verifies the treasury
balance under rules 4(3), 47 and 142* subject to the conditions stated in those
rules.

(iii) The balance in a sub treasury currency chest should be verified
at  the  close  of  business  on  the  day  on  which  accounts  for  the  month  are
closed  by  the  Sub  Treasury  Officer  or  other  officer  who  verifies  the  sub
treasury balance under Rule 61 and he should send a verification certificate
in Form T. R. 39 to  the Treasury Officer. An inspecting officer who verifies the
treasury balance at such a sub treasury should also verify the currency chest
balance and send a verification certificate to the Currency Officer.

(iv) At every change in the incumbency of the post of either of two
government servants holding joint charge of a currency chest, the balance
should be verified by the relieving government servant in the presence of the
outgoing Government servant and of the other government servant who holds
joint charge and a report of the correctness of the balance of notes and coin
should be sent to the Currency Officer.

(v) The Treasury Officer should send the Currency Officer every
month a consolidated verification certificate in Form T.R. 39 for the currency
chests  in  his  districts  other  than  chests  in  the  sole  custody  of  the  Bank,
showing the balance in each chest separately and certifying that the balance
in the district treasury chest, if any, is correct and that he has received from

the  Sub  Treasury  Officers  or  the  Government  servants  holding  their  keys
certificates of the correctness of the balances in the sub treasury chests. Sub
Treasury Officers or the Government servants holding their keys should submit
these certificates to the Treasury Officer in Form T.R. 39. Each certificate in
Form T.R.  39  should  be  retained  by  the  Currency  Officer  or  the Treasury
Officer as the case may be, until the next one relating to the same district or
chest has been received.

(vi) The balance in a currency chest not in the sole custody of the

Bank should be verified in the following manner:—

(a) The balance of notes or coin kept in receptacles which have
not  been  operated  on  since  the  last  verification  and  which  are  under  the
previous verifying government servants seal need not all be examined at each
verification, but the examination should be so arranged that no receptacle is
left unverified for over six months. The seal to be affixed on such receptacles
should be the private seal of the verifying government servant or a special
seal kept in the custody of the Collector or a gazetted assistant of the district
staff other than the Treasury Officer. The seals on the receptacles left unverified
at any monthly verification should be scrutinised carefully to see that they are
intact.

(b) Notes  should  be  counted  and  examined  in  the  manner

prescribed in clause (b) (i) of Rule 144.

SECTION  V

Custody etc., of Other Valuables

(a)    STAMPS

154. The  bulk  of  the  stock  of  adhesive  stamps  and  stamped  papers
should  be  kept  in  the  double  lock  strong  room  in  one  more  double  lock
receptacles, of which the keys should be held in the same manner as those of
double lock receptacles used for moneys. Every place in which any stamps
are stored should always be kept properly dry. Stamps should be made up for
reception into double locks in parcels each of which contains a known quantity
of stamps of a single denomination. In a district treasury a limited amount of
stamps, not exceeding the probable amount required for sale during a week,
may be kept in the Treasurer’s sole custody under single lock. In a sub treasury
a small stock of stamps required for current purposes, not exceeding a maximum
amount which the District Treasury Officer should fix for each sub treasury,

                                                                   104

may be kept in the Treasurer’s sole custody under single lock. Stamps should
be sold from the single lock store. The detailed rules regarding manufacture,
custody, supply, sale, etc, issued under the Kerala Stamp Act and the Indian
Stamp Act should also be strictly followed.

When a supply of stamps is received at a treasury, the officer in charge
of  the  treasury  should  personally,  examine  the  outward  appearance  of  the
boxes or packets and satisfy himself that they bear no marks of having been
tampered with. He should then have them opened in his presence and the
contents of each box or packets should be counted, either by himself or in his
presence, immediately on its being opened. He should compare the number
and value of the stamps received with the invoice or the passed indent and
send a receipt for them at once to the government servant who supplied them.

(b)    BANDEROLS

155. The procedure prescribed in Rule 154 should be followed generally

in regard to receipt, custody and issue of banderols also.

(c)  OPIUM  AND  GANJA

156. The main stock of opium and ganja should be kept in the double lock
strong room in one or more double lock receptacles, the keys of which should be
held in the same manner as those of double lock receptacles used for moneys. In
a district treasury no stock need ordinarily be kept in the Chief Treasurer’s sole
custody, but, if it is found necessary in practice to permit the Chief Treasurer to
keep a small amount of opium and ganja under single lock, the District Treasury
Officer should, with reference to the conditions in his district, fix the maximum
amount which may be so kept. Sales should be made from the single lock store, if
there is one.

 In a sub treasury a small amount of opium and ganja required for current
purposes, not exceeding the maximum amount which the District Treasury Officer
should fix for each sub treasury may be kept in the Treasurer’s sole custody under
single lock, and opium and ganja should be sold from the single lock store.

The detailed rules contained in the State Excise Manual and special orders,
if any, regarding the custody, sale, etc., of opium and ganja should be strictly
adhered to.

                                                                   105

treasury when sent there for that purpose:—

(a) Sealed boxes purporting to contain jewellery or other valuables
brought into court of law under the Civil Rules of Practice and Criminal Rules
of  Practice  provided  that  a  written  request  is  received  from  the  presiding
officer of the court.

(b) Sealed  packets  purporting  to  contain  duplicate  keys  and
padlocks of strong rooms and currency chests for the branches of the State
Bank of India/State Bank of Travancore and sealed boxes purporting to contain
duplicate keys of the padlocks used on remittance boxes held by the Agents
of the State Bank of India/State Bank of Travancore on behalf of the Reserve
Bank of India.

(c) Sealed packets purporting to contain duplicate keys of iron safes
and  cash  chests  provided  for  the  use  of  government  institutions  and
government servants.

(d) Cash chests of Co-operative Land Mortgage Banks.

(e) Box containing the duplicate keys of the cash chests of local
bodies  and  co-operative  societies  registered  under  the  Co-operative
Societies Act.

of the Collector or Additional District Magistrate (Personal Assistant to the
Collector) pending their disposal in auction, provided a written request is
received from the officer concerned;

(h) Sealed  cash  chests  and  sealed  packets  purporting  to  contain
valuables not falling under clause (a), (b), (c), (d), (f), (g), or (gg) above and
iron safes and chests of private banks provided that no such safe, chest or
packet may be received unless the District Treasury Officer has issued an

order  authorising  the  treasury  to  receive  it  for  safe  custody.  Such  orders
issued  by  the  District  Treasury  Officer  shall  be  subject  to  scrutiny  and
approval post facto by the Director. In doubtful cases the District Treasury
Officer shall obtain the sanction of the Director in advance.

Whenever a District Treasury Officer issues an order authorizing a
treasury to receive a safe, chest or packet for safe custody with reference to
sub para above, he should communicate a copy of the order (together with a
copy of the application when necessary) to the Accountant General so that
he may examine the propriety of the grant of permission.

As regards the receipt of iron safes and chests of private banks for
safe  custody  in  treasuries  with  reference  to  the  first  sub  para  above  the
following further instructions shall be followed:—

If the chests or safes of any private bank are small in size and not too
many, they may be accommodated in treasuries and sub treasuries where,
space is available. Application for such accommodation should be made to
the District Treasury Officer. If the accommodation is to be made in a sub
treasury, the District Treasury Officer shall deal with such applications in
consultation with the Sub Treasury Officer. In the event of a refusal to give
such accommodation, the District Treasury Officer should make a report to
the Director explaining in detail the reasons for refusal to afford the facility to
the applicant banking company. The Director will forward to the Government
the report of the District Treasury Officer with his remarks and the Government
will then review the case.

In cases where the facility is granted, the depositing banks will have
to keep and remove their safes or chests with reference to their daily or periodical
requirements in the presence of both the double lock officers of the treasury.
With a view to avoid dislocation of work in treasuries and sub treasuries on
this account, it is necessary to fix definite hours for the agents of the private
banks for operating on their chests in the strong room. The hours between
10.30 a.m. and 4 p.m. on working days other than Saturdays between 10.30
a.m. and 1 p.m. on Saturdays may be generally suitable. The Treasury Officer
concerned will fix a definite time for this purpose in consultation with the bank
concerned.

                                                                   107

RULES  157-158

 The Treasury or Sub Treasury Officer accepting the cash chests or
safes of private banks for safe custody in the strong room will not take any
cognizance  of  the  contents  of  the  chests  or  safes  and  the  receipts  to  the
banks will be issued in the form prescribed in Rule 158 below with a remark
that the contents of the chests or safes are unknown.

Rent at a flat rate of  `.5 per mensem or part thereof will be collected
in advance for each safe or chest for which accommodation is lent. The receipts
on account of this should be credited to the Government under “0070. Other
Administrative Services”.

158.

(1) No  cash  chest  or  packet  containing  valuables  should  be
received at a treasury for safe custody unless it is properly sealed. When any
such article is received at a district treasury, the Treasury Officer and the Chief
Treasurer should examine it carefully to see that the seals are intact and place
it under double locks, and the Treasury Officer should give a receipt for it
merely acknowledging the receipt of sealed cash chest or packet. When any
such article is received at a sub treasury, the Sub Treasury Officer should
follow the same procedure.

The Treasury Officer or the Sub Treasury Officer as the case may be should
insist  on  the  return  of  any  written  acknowledgement  or  safe  custody  receipt
granted by the treasury before he returns any cash chest or packet containing
valuable out of safe custody.

The treasury should maintain a safe custody register in Form T.R. 28 and
record in it the necessary particulars regarding all sealed cash chests and sealed
packets received for safe custody.

The receipt to be issued by the officer in charge of a district treasury or sub
treasury as the case may be, when acknowledging receipt of a sealed cash chest
or packet for safe custody, should be in the form of a printed receipt with counterfoil
bound into a book, serially numbered. The counterfoil alone should be signed
and issued for every receipt of cash chest or sealed packet. When the sealed cash
chest or packet is returned the counterfoil issued at the time of its receipt at the
treasury should be got back, signed and pasted on to its original bearing the same
number in the printed receipt book. The printed receipt should be in the form
noted below:—

                                                                   108

weapons accepted for safe custody during each financial year. A receipt in the
Form prescribed in sub-rule (1) with suitable modifications shall be given to
the depositor at the time of receipt of the weapons. A separate receipt book
shall be utilised for the purpose. Whenever weapons deposited for safe custody
are to be returned to the depositing officer, the original receipt issued at the
time  of  deposit  of  the  weapon,  shall  be  got  back  and  kept  pasted  on  the
treasury copy of the receipt concerned, kept in the treasury.

In the case of articles deposited for safe custody in treasuries
and which remain unclaimed for a period of more than 25 years from the date
of original deposit, the District Treasury Officer shall publish a notification in

If no claimant comes forward to claim back the item within the prescribed
period, then the District Treasury Officer shall open the packets in the presence

contents of the packets shall then be disposed of in public auction and if they
are of no marketable value, destroyed. The proceeds, if any, of the sale shall
be credited to the miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury Department. In the
case of such articles available at the Sub Treasuries, they shall be transferred
to the concerned District Treasury and included in the Register of safe custody
articles of the District Treasury and thereafter action taken as envisaged above.
Such articles in the District and Sub Treasuries shall be taken up for disposal
once in a year, in April and action completed within 3 months.

DEPARTMENTAL  CASH  CHESTS

159.

In regard to a departmental cash chest *or a sealed box containing
thondi articles deposited by a court, only a single entry should be made in the
safe  custody  register;  this  should  be  made  at  the  time  when  the  chest  *or
sealed box is first deposited and the authority under which it is received for
safe custody should be quoted. A separate departmental cash chest register
in Form T.R. 40 should also be kept for each such chest *or sealed box showing
the particulars of the daily (or periodical) return and re-deposit of the chest
*or sealed box. On each occasion when the chest *or sealed box is deposited
in the treasury, the District Treasury Officer/Sub Treasury Officer or the Section
Head/Head Accountant, as the case may be, should acknowledge its receipt
in this register, which should remain with the depositing officer so long as the
chest *or sealed box is in the treasury. When the depositing officer wishes to
withdraw the chest *or sealed box, he should send the register to the treasury
after signing in column (3) in token that he has authorized the messenger
named in column (2) to receive the chest *or sealed box. On receipt of the
signed register, the Treasury Officer or the Sub Treasury Officer, as the case
may be, should return the chest *or sealed box and obtain the messenger’s
signature in column (4) of the register as an acknowledgment of his having
received the chest *or sealed box.

RULES  159-161

A treasury should not receive any cash chest *or sealed box for safe
custody unless it is properly locked as well as sealed, and should not take
charge of any key of a cash chest *or sealed box received for safe custody.
The Treasury Officer or the Sub Treasury Officer is responsible only for duly
returning  the  sealed  chest  *or  sealed  box  with  the  seals  intact  when  the
depositing officer sends necessary acknowledgment. If the chest *or sealed
box  is  duly  returned  with  the  seals  intact,  the  depositing  officer  remains
fully  responsible  for  the  correctness  of  its  contents.

NOTE— The above procedure will apply to the cash chests *or sealed boxes

of Co-operative Land Mortgage Bank also.

160. The Treasury Officer or the Sub Treasury Officer, as the case may
be, should verify the presence of all the sealed chests and packets in safe
custody in the treasury periodically at intervals not exceeding six months and
satisfy himself that the seals of each chest or packet are intact and note the
result of his verification in the safe custody register. Whenever a Treasury
Officer or a Sub Treasury Officer hands over charge (otherwise than temporarily
in such circumstances that the government servant temporarily in charge will
have no occasion to deal with the articles in safe custody), the relieved and
the  relieving  government  servants  should  personally  hand  over  and  take
charge, respectively of all the sealed chests and packets in safe custody in the
treasury, and sign the safe custody register in token that they have done so.
Whenever  the  Chief  Treasurer  of  a  district  treasury  or  Treasurer  of  a  sub
treasury hands over charge (otherwise than temporarily in such circumstances
that the government servant temporarily in charge will have no occasion to
deal with the articles in safe custody), the relieving government servant should
verify the presence of all the sealed chests and packets in safe custody in
treasury and note the result of his verification in the safe custody register.

connection  with  the  receipt,  custody  and  delivery  of  any  sealed  packet
purporting to contain the duplicate keys of the padlocks used on the strong

space that could be used for making an interpolation.

The spaces left blank either in the money column or in the column for
particulars of the bill should invariably be covered by oblique lines. A note to
the effect that the amount, of the bill is below a specified amount expressed in
whole  rupees  should  invariably  be  recorded  (in  words  and  figures)  in  the

be similarly attested by the signing officer, if it is drawn on the Bank, and, in
other cases, by the Treasury or Sub Treasury Officer who signs it.

account, the drawer shall ordinarily present a separate bill for the amount
debitable to each major head.

RULE  163

(g) Unless the Government have expressly authorised it in the case
of any specified office, no bill or other document and no payment order shall
be signed by a clerk for the head of the office, even if it is customary for the
clerk to sign letters for him when he is absent. No bill or other document and
no payment order shall be signed with a stamp (facsimile). The head of an
office may authorise a gazetted government servant serving under him to sign
bills, other documents and payment orders for him but, if he does so, he shall
communicate the government servant’s name and specimen signature to the
treasury or treasuries concerned. A delegation of powers of this kind shall not
in any way, relieve the head of the office of his responsibility for the accuracy
of the bill, etc., and for the disposal of the moneys drawn from the treasury.

 When a claimant or payee is unable to sign his name, he may furnish
his signature on a bill or other document in the form of a mark or preferably
a thumb/great-toe-impression. No payment shall be made on any bill or other
document so signed, unless some person known to the treasury or bank, as
the case may be appears with the payee and identifies him and attests his
mark or thumb impression in token of his genuineness.

Similarly, when an illiterate person, who is unable to sign his name
in any language, draws a cheque on the treasury or the Bank by furnishing his
thumb/great-toe-impression on the cheque, no payment shall be made unless
some person known to the treasury or the Bank, as the case may be, appears
with the drawer and identifies him and attests his thumb impression in token
of its genuineness. The person who attests the thumb impression should be
one  who  is  not  employed  in  the  treasury  or  the  Bank  and  he  should  also
furnish his address.

NOTE—Bills  affixed  with  facsimile  signature  of  the  authorised  officer
presented  by  the  Posts  and  Telegraphs  Department  for  telegram
and trunk call charges, by the Municipalities and Corporations for
water and electricity charges and by the Air India International and
the  Indian Airlines  on  account  of  their  dues  against  Government
(for passage fares, cargo and excess luggage charges) forming sub-
vouchers of the contingent bills, may be accepted for payment, if
otherwise  in  order.

(h) When a rule or order requires that bills of a certain kind shall be
countersigned before payment, no such bill shall be presented at the treasury
until it has been duly countersigned.

PART  V

RULE  163

NOTE—On all bills on which countersignature is required before payment or
which  have  to  be  enfaced  for  payment  at  a  treasury  or  both,  the
words “contents received” which are usually printed above the place
for the signature of the drawing officer should be struck out at the
time the bill is first signed and before it is sent for countersignature
or  for  enfacement  for  payment  at  the  treasury.  When  the  bill  is
received back, the words “contents received” should be written on
it and signed and the bill then sent for encashment. All Treasury
Officers should be careful to see that such bills are not paid unless
they bear a second signature (acquittance of the officers concerned,
below the words “contents received”.)

(i) When a bill relates to a charge incurred under a special order of
sanction, the particulars of the order shall be entered on the bill, and a copy of
it  shall  be  attached  to  the  bill  and  duly  certified  to  be  a  true  copy  by  the
government servant who signs the bill.

*NOTE 1.—If an order of attachment against a government servant is received
before  a  previous  order  of  attachment  against  the  same
government  servant,  has  been  fully  complied  with,  the
recoveries shall be made by the disbursing officer so long as
the total amount recoverable with reference to the attachment
orders is within the maximum limits prescribed in Article 102,
Kerala Financial Code, Volume I.

NOTE  2.—If a new attachment order has the result of increasing the amount
beyond the maximum limits prescribed, the disbursing officer
shall return the attachment order to the Court concerned with
a statement showing:—

(i) Particulars of the existing attachment.

(ii) Particulars  of  the  amount  withheld  and  paid  into  the  Court
concerned upto date in respect of the existing attachment; and

(iii)

(a)    the  balance  amount    available  to  be  recovered  after

effecting the   existing attachment.—

(b) the actual attachable  amount.

RULE  163

(j) The drawing officer shall deduct from a bill for the pay, etc., of an
establishment any amount attached by a prohibitory order of a court of law.
He shall attach to each establishment pay bill, in which any such deduction is
made,  an  advice  list  containing  particulars  of  the  suit,  the  name  of  the
government servant whose pay is attached and the amount deducted from
the bill. When the court which issued the attachment order is not suited at the
headquarters of the treasury which pays the bills the drawing officer shall
also attach to the bill a postal money order form duly prepared for the remittance
of the amount by the Treasury Officer to the court. The commission payable
to the post office on the money order shall be shown as a deduction in the bill
as well as the amount to be remitted. The procedure to be followed by the
Treasury Officer for remitting such amounts to the courts is laid down in Rule
211 and also the procedure that he should follow in paying attached amounts
to courts located at this headquarters.

(k) Recoveries from the salary of government servants on account
of dues to co-operative societies registered under the various Co-operative
Societies  Acts,  where  such  Acts  impose  a  statutory  obligation  on  the
Government  to  make  such  deductions,  shall  be  made  by  the  drawing  and
disbursing officers in the case of non-gazetted government servants who do
not draw their own bills, and in other cases, by the treasury Officers or other
disbursing officers concerned, as the case may be, in accordance with such
procedure as may be laid down by Government from time to time.

(l) Deductions made in bills shall, where required by the rules relating
to such deductions, e.g., Provident Funds, Postal Life Insurance, State Life
Insurance (Official Branch), etc., be supported by schedule in the prescribed
form detailing the deductions made Schedules for Provident Fund deductions
shall be prepared in Form T.R. 104. If such deductions are made in a bill in
respect of two or more subscribers whose accounts are maintained by different
Audit Officers separate schedules shall be attached to the bill in respect of the
deductions which are to be accounted for by each Audit Officer.

When  recovery is made from occupants of Government residential
buildings by deductions from pay bills, one copy of the demand statement,
which will be rendered in duplicate in T.R. 43 giving particulars of the recoveries
shall be attached to the pay bills. After the recovery has been made, the remaining

copy of the demand statement shall be returned to the authority from which it was
received after noting the amounts recovered and recording a certificate to the
effect if the recoveries are in order, that the recovery has been made and the
emoluments are correct.    When recovery is made on account of an interest-
bearing advance a schedule of recovery in Form T.R. 106, separately for each type
of such advance, shall be attached to the bill in which the recovery is made. In the
case of such recoveries from the claims of non-gazetted government servants, the
drawing officer shall certify on the recovery schedule attached to the bill for the
month of February encashed in the month of March every year that the balance
shown as outstanding therein have been accepted as correct by the government

part of the amount of the bill to a person or persons (other than the drawer)
by postal money order, the necessary money order form or forms duly filled
up, except for the date and the Treasury Officer’s signature, shall be presented
with the bill, and the drawer shall show both the amount to be sent by money
order and the commission due on it as deductions in the bill.

Exception—The money order forms relating to payment of the bill for

specifically endorse on it and sign an order to pay to that person specifying
his name as well as his designation. All such bills, cheques or other documents
preferable at a treasury for payment being non-negotiable instruments, can be
endorsed only once in favour of the specific party to whom the money is to be
paid:

Provided that—

(1) when the endorsement is made on a bill or cheque in favour of a
banker, a second endorsement can be made by the banker in favour of a messenger
or an agent for collection only;

(2)

a firm of suppliers or private parties under the provisions of Rule 188 (viii), the firm
of the private party can re-endorse to its banker or to a messenger for collection
only and the banker can in turn endorse it to a messenger or an agent for collection
only. Thus, in all three endorsements are permissible in such cases provided that,

impression in the presence of the Treasury Officer and have it
attested  by  a  person  well-known  to  the  Treasury.  The  person
attesting the thumb impression should be one who is not employed
in the Treasury or the Bank and he should also furnish his address.

RULE  163

(r) A government servant shall not issue a copy of any bill or other
document which has already been paid on the allegation that the payer’s copy
has been lost or is not available, although a certificate may, when necessary, be
given that on a specified day a certain sum was paid to a certain person on a
certain account. A fee of one rupee shall be levied for each certificate issued to a
private party. This prohibition extends only to the issue of a copy on the allegation
that the payee’s copy has been lost or is not available, and does not apply to a
copy marked “Not payable at the treasury” and tendered at the treasury with the
original in accordance with the rules.

If  a  bill  or  other  document  that  has  been  passed  for  payment  at  the
treasury is alleged to have been lost before payment, the government servant
who drew the original bill or other document shall ascertain from the treasury
whether payment has already been made on the original or not, and shall request
the treasury not to make payment on the original if presented subsequently. If the
treasury has not made payment on the original, he may issue a duplicate which

the exemptions, etc., listed in Appendix 8.

#This amendment shall be deemed to have into force on 13th May, 1994.

NOTE—(1)

In determining whether the receipt obtained in respect of an amount
drawn on a bill preferred against Government should be stamped
or not, the net amount of the bill and not the gross amount payable
should be taken into account, unless the receipt is exempted under
exceptions referred to above.

NOTE—(2)

Receipts  for  payments  made  outside  India  should  be  obtained
from the payees and stamped in accordance with the local laws, if
any, governing the stamping of such receipts.

NOTE—(3) A single receipt, stamped where necessary given by a payee in
acknowledgement of several payments or a lump sum payment,
either in cash or by cheque, made to him, on one occasion, shall
constitute  a  valid  quittance  and  the  disbursing  officer  in  such
cases, should give cross reference on all vouchers to which the
receipt relates.

for pay and fixed allowances shall be presented on a bill in Form T.R. 46. A
gazetted government servant who draws a special pay or allowance in respect
of a separate office of which he is in additional charge, need not present a

of the State.

*NOTE 1#—Gazetted officers are authorised to draw their pay and allowances
provisionally without pay slip from the Accountant General up
to  a  period  of  3  months  after  the  expiry  of  sanction  to  the

these posts on the basis of a certificate in Form T.R. 112 being
attached to the pay bill. The certificate should be signed by the
Controlling Officers authorised to sign their T.A. bills. In cases
where the officer is himself the Controlling Officer for T.A claims,

from the Audit Officer who audited his pay before he proceeded on leave. In case
where a period of leave is followed by transfer, such portion of the leave salary as
could not be drawn at the old station may, however, be drawn at the treasury from
which the pay in respect of the new post is drawn.

(c) If gazetted government servant signs his bill himself, he must either
appear in person at the place of payment or furnish a life certificate signed by a
responsible officer of Government or some other well known and trustworthy
person. If he draws his leave salary through an authorised agent, the agent whether
he has or has not the power of attorney, must either furnish a life certificate as
aforesaid, or execute a bond to refund overpayments. A life certificate may be
given  periodically,  a  bond  being  given  to  cover  intermediate  payments  not

leave salary or fixed allowance, unless the bills in which he claims it is accompanied
by a letter from the Accountant General authorising the changed rate. A fresh
authorisation from the Accountant General is also required when there is a change
in designation of a gazetted officer, even if there is no change in emoluments. The
Accountant General shall issue these letters as early as possible, but when any
such change occurs near the end of a month or takes effect from a date which
cannot immediately be ascertained and cannot be fixed by a certificate of transfer
of charge appended to the bill, the government servant concerned should draw
his bill at not more than the old rate, if he does not receive the letter of authority by
the end of the month.

to him by the Accountant General before his proceeding on leave
and, if such authority has been superseded, on the basis of such
revised authority for pay and allowances.

the banker or agent by means of a distinct pay order. The receipt of the banker or
agent alike, if it is recorded on the bill itself or separately, shall be stamped unless
the receipt on the bill has already been duly signed and stamped by the government
servant himself. No re-endorsement of such a bill by the bank or agent otherwise

indemnity bond in Form T.R. 49 or Form T.R. 50 duly stamped, as security for the
refund to the Government of any overpayment to the government servant, a life
certificate showing that the government servant was alive on the last day of the
period to which the claim relates and signed by a responsible government servant,
or, if there is no such government servant at the place some other well known and
trustworthy person shall be furnished along with each bill. Life certificates may be
furnished at intervals, as may be convenient, provided that an indemnity bond
has been executed which will cover intermediate payments not supported by a life
certificate.

The Treasury Officer shall enter the particulars of all powers of attorney
furnished with reference to this rule in the register (in Form 16 of the Government
Securities Manual) kept in the treasury for the purpose.
NOTE— When  separate  bills  for  leave  salary,  vacation  pay,  etc.,  relating  to
different  periods  are  presented  and  paid  simultaneously  it  is  not
necessary to furnish separate “Life Certificates” for the different periods.
Only one certificate in respect of the date of presentation of the bills
should be enough.

Exceptions— In  the  following  cases  the  life  certificates  should  not  be

insisted  on:—

(i) when the arrears of leave salary are drawn by a Gazetted Officer

after he has resumed duty;

(ii) when the leave salary is claimed in the same bill as the duty pay for

the period following that of leave salary; and

(iii) when the report of taking over charge after the expiry of leave has

already been sent to Treasury Officer.

(b)       An indemnity bond executed by a bank or agent for the purpose
of drawing pay, etc., on behalf of a single government servant shall be in Form T.R.

standing has a number of constituents who are government servants and desire
to  draw  their  pay,  etc.,  through  it,  the  Government,  in  consultation  with  the
Accountant General, may, if they think fit, permit the bank (or firm) to execute a
single indemnity bond in respect of all pay, etc., drawn by it from the Government
on behalf of such government servants. Such a bond shall be in Form T.R. 49 and
shall be duly stamped. Appendix 9 contains lists of the banks, etc., which have
executed such bonds. All indemnity bonds whether in Form T.R. 49 or Form T.R.
50 shall be properly stamped.

Indemnity bonds in Form T.R. 50 executed by a bank or agent for the
purpose of drawing pay, etc., on behalf of a single government servant shall
be kept in the custody of the Treasury Officer. General indemnity bonds in
Form T.R. 49 for the purpose of drawing pay, etc., on behalf of government
servants of the Kerala Government alone shall be kept in the custody of the
Government.

No endorsement of a bill drawn on behalf of a government servant
by  a  bank  or  agent  permitted  to  draw  the  Government  servant’s  pay,  etc.,
under this rule shall be recognised with the exception of an endorsement to
a  messenger  for  collection.

(c) A  bond  in  Form T.R.  49  executed  by  an  unincorporated  firm
requires that information be given to the Government at once if there is any
change in the constitution of the firm. As soon as any such information is
received, the new partnership shall be required to execute a fresh bond in
Form T.R. 50 by a specified date or acknowledge in writing that it is bound
by the existing bond by which the old partnership was bound, if it wishes to
retain the privilege of drawing pay, etc., on behalf of government servants.

*168. (a) Place of Payment.—The  claims  of  a  Gazetted  Government
Servant shall be drawn from the District/Sub Treasury to which his institution
is attached either under the orders of the Accountant General for under the
orders of the Director of Treasuries or in accordance with the notifications
published  by  the  Government  realigning  the  jurisdiction  of  District/Sub
Treasuries.

(b) When any pay is due in India to a government servant who is
absent from India, he should make his own arrangements to receive it in India.

Provided that when the government servant has finally quitted India
and it is not possible for him to make his own arrangements for receiving his
pay and allowances in India, payment may be made to him through the High
Commissioner for India or through the India Office.

NOTE—When a government servant who is away from the State on study
leave or undergoing a course of training, etc., desires payment of his
leave salary or pay and allowances within the State, the procedure
prescribed in Rule 165 (c) should be followed.

checked by adding up the items. If the bill relates to a small establishment the
drawing officer shall either check it himself, or have it checked by a gazetted
government servant under his order, before he signs it. If the bill relates to a large
establishment, the drawing officer shall ensure that the whole bill is thoroughly
checked by someone other than the clerk who prepared it, and shall himself check
a part of the bill or arrange for a gazetted government servant to do so, before he
signs it.

General.

*NOTE. 2—The stipend and kit allowance payable to Sub Inspector Cadets who
are undergoing training in Police Training College shall be drawn
consolidated  in  establishment  pay  bills  on  the  basis  of  an
attendance  statement  prepared  under  due  attestation  of  the

acquittance through the Inspector, Training Team.

† NOTE—3 The  shift  allowance  payable  to  the  staff  of  the  Printing  and

(c) The leave salary of a non-gazetted government servant on leave
cannot be drawn in India, except over the signature of the head of his office; and
the latter is responsible for any overcharge.

The  leave  salary  of  a  non-gazetted  government  servant  holding  a
permanent post in one office and officiating in a post in another office may be
drawn at the office from which he proceeded on leave, if he would have continued
in that office but for his leave and is expected to return to it on its expiry. No last
pay certificate should be issued in such cases but the fact of the government
servant having gone on leave should, however, be intimated to the head of the
first  office  so  that  he  can  show  the  necessary  arrangements  in  the  absentee
statements of his office. The bills in which leave salary is drawn should also
indicate the permanent post on which the absentee holds a lien to facilitate correct
classification of leave salary.

In the case of a non-gazetted officer whose substantive appointment is
not  a  local  appointment,  but  simply  that  of  a  member  of  a  State  staff,  leave
allowances should be drawn either at the place where the office of the head of his
department is located, by the head of his department or at the place where his
salary was last disbursed and in the latter case, if he was not himself the head of
an office, he should be regarded as attached to the office in which he was last
employed, and the head of that office should draw the leave allowances and he
regarded as responsible for over charges.

RULES  170-171

170.

If for any reason the rate of leave salary to be drawn on behalf on
a non-gazetted government servant on leave is not known (e.g., when the
kind of leave to be granted has not been settled by the sanctioning authority),
the pay to which he would have been entitled if he had remained on duty shall
be entered in red ink in the money column of the bill intended for entering
leave salary and the amount shall be left undisbursed and treated as held over
till the rate of leave salary becomes known. When a drawing officer claims
leave salary based on average pay on behalf of any government servant he
shall sign and attach to the first bill in which the claim is made a statement of
the calculations determining the amount of leave salary claimed. If any pay
drawn outside the government servant’s substantive office or section enters
into the calculations, the statement shall include references to the vouchers
on which, or the office in which, such pay was drawn. When a drawing officer
claims leave salary based on actual pay on behalf of any government servant,
he shall sign and attach to the bill a certificate that the leave salary is claimed
at the same rate as the substantive pay of the government servant on the day
immediately preceding that on which the leave commenced within the meaning
of the note under Rule 93, Part I of the Kerala Service Rules. This certificate is
however  not  necessary  in  the  case  of  maternity  leave  even  though  leave
salary is claimed at the same rate as full pay.

NOTE.—No statement of the calculations determining the amount of leave
salary  claimed  need  be  attached  to  pay  bills  in  respect  of  those
Government servants whose names are omitted from the bill (See
Rule 171 below:)

171. The names of government servants of the following classes may

be omitted from pay bills:—

(i) Government servants for whom service books are not required
to be maintained (Vide Rule 172 of Part III of the Kerala Service
Rules.)

(ii) All government servants in last grade service.

Each bill from which names have been omitted in accordance with the
rule  shall  contain  sufficient  information  to  enable  the  treasury  and  the
Accountant General to apply the necessary arithmetical checks and the drawing
officer shall certify on it as follows:—

PART  V

RULES  171-173

“Certified that every government servant on whose behalf pay or leave
salary is claimed in this bill has actually been on duty or on authorised leave,
as the case may be, during the month for the period on account of which his
pay  or  leave  salary  is  claimed  and  that  full  details  of  the  names  of  the
government servants concerned and the emoluments drawn for them working
upto the total included in this bill have been duly shown in the office copy”.

The government may in consultation with the Accountant General extend
the provisions of this rule to other specified classes of establishments, when
the entry of names in the bills is not essential for audit purposes.

Claims on behalf of government servants whose names are omitted from
a bill under this rule shall not be included in a single item except so far as they
are identical in all respects. For example, a claim for the whole month for five
Head Constables each of whom draws a pay of  ` 57 a month may be entered
as a single item.  Claims on behalf of government servants with different
designations  or  government  servants  who  have  the  same  designation  but
draw pay at different rates or for different periods shall always be shown
separately.

172. The drawing officer shall have the office copy of every pay bill
relating to government servants of the two classes mentioned at the beginning
of Rule 171 prepared separately so as to show full details of names, leave,
etc. Total of this pay bill shall then be entered in the pay bill for government
servants  of  other  classes  and  the  drawing  officer  shall  see  that  the  grand
total of the latter agrees with the total amount shown in the fair copy.

The “pay of menials” charged to “contingencies” shall not be included

in establishment pay bills—See Appendix II.

173. Absentee statement.—The drawing officer shall ordinarily attach
an absentee statement in Form T.R. 52 to the monthly establishment pay bill if
any person other than a last grade servant has been absent during the month
on leave (other than casual leave), or deputation, or suspension, or without
leave  or  if  a  post  has  been  left  vacant  substantively,  whether  or  not  any
government  servant  officiated  in  it  (c.f.  Note  5  on  the  form  itself).  When
signing the absentee statement the drawing officer shall see that a diagonal
line is drawn across the blank space, if any, below the last entry. If no such
government servant has been absent otherwise than on casual leave during
the  month  the  drawing  officer  shall  sign  second  certificate  printed  on  the
establishment  pay  bill.  Form  T.R.  52  also  makes  provisions  for  separate

statements of substantive changes in regard to members of the establishment and
must, therefore, be filled up and attached to the monthly establishment pay bill,
whenever there has been any change that has to be included in these statements
of  substantive  changes,  even  if  there  is  no  entry  to  be  made  in  the  absentee
statement proper.

When the scale of an establishment is fixed for the State or a District, the
controlling authority shall submit to the Accountant General, not later than the
date fixed by the latter, a consolidated absentee statement for each month showing
the complete chain of arrangements. The head of an office need not attach an
absentee statement in Form T.R. 52 to his monthly establishment pay bill so far as
it relates to any establishment the scale of which is fixed for the State or a district.

174. First  drawal  of  pay.—When  the  name  of  a  government  servant
appointed to a post other than in the last grade service appears for the first time in
the pay bill of an establishment, the previous post in government service, if any
held by him shall be stated and a last pay certificate attached showing the date of
handing over charge advance, outstanding, etc. If he was not holding any such
appointment previously or is re-employed after resignation or forfeiture of past
service the drawing officer shall furnish a certificate in the bill to the effect that the
health certificate required by Rule 13 of Part I, Kerala Service Rules has been
obtained from the competent authority and filed in the office. In the case of non-
gazetted government servant mentioned in Exception to Rule 169 (b) above instead
of the drawing officer the Gazetted Officer countersigning the bill shall record the
necessary certificate in the bill.

NOTE.—Rules 163 (d) to 163 (g) above will apply to non-gazetted establishment

also.

175. *Increment.—(a)   “A register of increment” will be maintained by the

Drawing Officer, in Form 9A prescribed in Volume II of Kerala Financial Code.

When an increment is claimed the drawing officer will make a note in red ink
against the relevant claim in the pay bill. Increment raising pay to  `…………………
with effect from ………………….. authorised and noted in the Service book.

NOTE.—Also see Articles 89, 90 and 91 of the Kerala Financial Code, Volume I.

(b) When an increment claimed, has been specifically withheld/operates
to carry the government servant over an efficiency bar/is conditional on the
acquisition of departmental tests or completion of the period of probation, a
copy of the order issued by the competent authority, sanctioning the increment

and specifying that the order is fit to cross the efficiency bar/has passed the
departmental examination(s) or completed the period of probation satisfactorily,
as the case may be, should be attached to the pay bill in each case in addition
to the notings required under (a) above. In case the increment claimed involves
reckoning of broken periods of service an explanatory memorandum showing
briefly how the date of increment has been arrived at, shall also be attached to
the bill.

176. Arrear bills.—Arrear pay shall be drawn on a separate bill and
not in the ordinary monthly pay bill. The amount of arrears claimed for each
month  shall  be  entered  separately  in  the  bill  with  a  reference  to  the  bill
from which the amount was omitted, or withheld or in which it was recovered
by  deduction.  If  the  claim  relates  to  an  allowance  or  special  pay  newly
sanctioned, the name of the authority which sanctioned it and the number
and date of the sanction order shall be entered in the bill. Arrear bills may be
presented at any time subject to the conditions prescribed by the Government
in that regard (See Articles *52 to 58 of the Kerala Financial Code) and may
include as many items as are necessary. The drawing officer shall certify in
every  arrear  bill  that  no  part  of  the  amount  claimed  has  been  drawn
previously. A note of the arrear bill shall invariably be made in the office
copy of the bills for the period to which the claim pertains, over the dated
initials  of  the  drawer  of  the  arrear  bill,  in  order  to  avoid  the  risk  of  the
arrears being claimed over again.

other than a retired Gazetted Government Servant, in respect of whom as Last Pay
Certificate has already been issued shall be drawn and disbursed in the same
manner as regular monthly pay, allowances etc. by the Head of the office from
which the Government Servant retired, on the responsibility of such Head Office
without reference to the departmental authorities and the Accountant General.
The surrender of Last Pay Certificate already issued shall not be insisted in such
cases. A revised Last Pay Certificate shall also be issued after the drawal and
disbursement of the arrear salary, where necessary. Outstanding T.A. claims of
such officers, may also be drawn and disbursed in the usual manner by the head
of the office from which the Government Servant retired.

NOTE— The term Government Servant used in exceptions (2) and (4) above
includes  a  non-gazetted  officer  who  was  drawing  the  pay  and
allowances on salary bills countersigned by a gazetted officer having
control over him as mentioned in the exception to rule 169 (b).

If the emoluments of a government servant upto the date of his transfer
to a new post are not drawn before he proceeds to the new post [See sub clause
(ii) of clause (d) of article 87 of the Kerala Financial Code] and his emoluments for
the whole month are therefore drawn together in the new post, the allocation of
the charge between the old post and the new post should be clearly indicated in
the bill. The last pay certificate of a non-gazetted government servant should give
the information necessary to enable the drawing officer to note the allocation
correctly in the bill of the new office. A gazetted or other government servant who
draws his own bills is himself responsible for showing the correct allocation of the
charge in any bill relating to service in more than one post.

case of gazetted officers and the drawing officer in the case of non-gazetted
officers. If a non-gazetted officer is himself the drawing officer his last pay
certificate should be countersigned by his immediate superior gazetted officer.
The Accountant General will direct, when he issues the order for the payment
of the pension, that no payment be made until a last pay certificate has been
produced at the treasury where the first payment of pension is made. In cases
where the application for pension to the Accountant General is made after
retirement,  the  last  pay  certificate  should  be  submitted  along  with  the
application for pension.

gazetted,  who  is  certified  by  a  Magistrate  to  be  lunatic  should  be  paid  in
accordance  with  the  following  procedure  under  the  provisions  of  section
95 (1) of the Indian Lunacy Act, 1912.

(1)  (a) On receipt of information that a government servant has
been certified to be a lunatic, the head of the office in which the government
servant, before his being certified to be a lunatic was last employed should
on the basis of the orders issued by the appointing authority indicating the
person(s)  to  whom  and  the  proportion  in  which  the  pay  and  allowances
admissible to the government servant may be disbursed in accordance with
the provisions of section 95 (1) of the Indian Lunacy Act, 1912, draw the
pay and allowances of the government servant in the appropriate bill form,
gazetted or non-gazetted as the case may be, from the treasury or other office
of disbursement. The claim should be supported by all the relevant certificates
which the Head of the Office is required to furnish in the normal circumstances.
However, in respect of the certificates which solely depend on the personal
knowledge of the government servant and which cannot be furnished in such
cases,  the  head  of  the  office  should  record,  if  he  is  satisfied  about  the
reasonableness of the claim a certificate to the effect that the claim is not
susceptible of verification but is considered reasonable. If the government
servant is invalided from service, the claim would be the last one in respect of
him and the requisite payment in case he was a gazetted government servant
shall be made only after the head of the office has satisfied himself by the
reference to the Accountant General, the department authorities, if any, and
his own records, that no government dues are outstanding against him. In
other cases payment may be made on the responsibility of the head of the
office concerned.

necessary.

(2) Where a government servant has been invalided from service
and it is found that some Government dues are outstanding against him even
after the adjustment of his claims for pay and allowances, the same may be
adjusted against the amount of his death-cum-retirement gratuity, if any, and
if the same is also insufficient, the balance of the outstanding dues may be

CONTINGENCIES  AND  OTHER  MISCELLANEOUS  EXPENDITURE

CHAPTER  III

(a)

187.

“Permanent advances” are granted to certain government
servants to enable them to meet contingent charges relating to their offices
before  drawing  bills  for  the  amounts.  When  a  permanent  advance  is
sanctioned  it  shall  be  drawn  from  the  treasury  on  a  bill  in  Form  T.R.  42
supported by a copy of the order sanctioning the advance. The several items
of contingent expenditure which are met from the permanent advance shall
be recorded in one or more registers to be maintained on each office in the
form  prescribed  for  the  purpose.

(b) A gazetted government servant who is the head of an office may
draw his office contingent bills. He may also delegate this power to a gazetted
government servant serving under him—[See Rule 163 (g)].

A non gazetted government servant who is the Head of an office may
draw his office contingent bills subject to the condition that such bills should
be countersigned before payment by a gazetted officer in control over him or
by  the  head  of  the  department  at  the  discretion  of  the  latter.  *No  such
countersignature  shall  be  required  for  the  drawal  of  wages  of  contingent
employees listed in Appendix II by those officers as listed in Appendix 10
Kerala Treasury Code, Volume II.

Exception.—(1) The Assistant Educational Officers shall draw rent bills
of Government Primary Schools in their jurisdiction;
such  bills  need  not  be  countersigned.

of the controlling authority before payment shall be drawn in Form T.R. 59.
The  Treasury  Officer  shall  not  pay  such  bills  unless  they  have  been  duly
countersigned.

(d) In  regard  to  contingent  expenditure  that  requires  the
countersignature of the controlling authority after payment, the drawing officer
shall present abstract bills in Form T.R. 60 at the Treasury for payment, and
send monthly detailed bills in K.F.C. form No. 11 to the controlling authority
for countersignature and transmission to the Accountant General. The detailed
bills  duly  countersigned  by  the  controlling  officer  shall  be  sent  to  the
Accountant General direct not later than the 20th of the month succeeding
that to which the bills relate. In the abstract bills the expenditure shall be
classified under the detailed account heads. The numbers assigned to the sub
vouchers pertaining to each entry in an abstract bill shall be shown against
the entry, and the amount of each sub voucher for more than $ ` 1000 shall be
stated. A certificate shall be attached to every abstract contingent bill to the
effect that the detailed contingent bills have been submitted to the controlling
officer in respect of abstract contingent bills drawn more than a month before
the date of that bill. On no account may an abstract contingent bill be cashed
without this certificate. **While forwarding the detailed contingent bill to the
Accountant General after counter signature by the controlling authority, the
Drawing and Disbursing Officers shall attach all sub-vouchers of rupees five
hundred and above, therewith. All sub-vouchers below rupees five hundred
shall be defaced, and a certificate of having defaced and retained all such sub-
vouchers shall be recorded in the detailed contingent bills by the controlling
authority.

individual payments exceeding $ `1000 and sign the prescribed certificate in
regard to the other sub vouchers.

188. The following further directions shall be followed when preparing

contingent bills:—

(i) The heads of account relating to contingent expenditure, i.e., the sub
head  of  appropriation,  the  detailed  account  head,  and  the  descriptive  item
subordinate to the detailed account head are generally printed in the form prescribed
for the purpose, according to the needs of the department concerned. If any such
relevant entries have not been printed in a bill form, they shall be entered in
manuscript in the bill, and the totals from the contingent registers shall be posted
against them.

(ii)

Full  details  regarding  any  expenditure  which  requires
explanation, e.g., miscellaneous charges, shall be entered in the bill, except when
they are available in sub vouchers that will be sent to the Accountant General.

(iii) As a rule, charges debitable to more than one major head of account
shall not be included in a single bill. Separate bills need not, however, be drawn for
such charges when they are shared in a fixed proportion by two branches of the
same office and are reviewed by the same authority, but the incidence of such
charges  shall  be  carefully  indicated  on  the  bills,  so  that  the  charges  may  be
properly classified in the accounts.

(iv) Certain prescribed certificates regarding items of contingent and
miscellaneous expenditure of various classes are required on contingent bills and
bills for miscellaneous expenditure—[see Rules 181, 187 (d) above and 188 (x)
below and also Appendix 4 of the Kerala Financial Code, Vol. II]. Certain certificates
of the same kind are also prescribed in departmental manuals or codes or are
printed on the form of bills intended for particular departments.

(v) Contingent charges that require the special previous sanction of
superior authority and those (other than the payment from contingencies) that
arise periodically (e.g., rents, rates, taxes, etc.) including those for which a fixed
allowance has been sanctioned, shall be drawn on separate bills, which shall
show clearly that the charges are of a special or periodical nature. Particulars of
the sanction of the expenditure shall be furnished on each such bill. When more
than one bill is drawn in respect of expenditure for which a lump sum has been

RULE  188

granted under a single special sanction, a note shall be made on the second
and  each  subsequent  bill  of  the  total  amount  spent  up-to-date  under  the
sanction.

NOTE— In the case of contingent bills payable at treasuries on account of
rents, rates, taxes, etc., due to local bodies which have a banking
account at the treasury, the bill shall be endorsed in favour of the
local body concerned irrespective of the amount involved.

(vi) The pay and fixed allowances of a member of the staff borne
under contingencies who has been declared to be ineligible for pension and
actually discharge duties appertaining to one of the classes of staff described
in Appendix II whatever his designation may be, shall be drawn on contingent
bills. No other pay and allowances of any kind shall be drawn on a contingent
bill.

(vii) When  a  permanent  advance  is  running  short  and  payments
exceeding  the  balance  have  to  be  made  at  once,  these  items  too  may  be
included in the bill, entering against them the numbers that the sub-vouchers
will bear when the payments have been made—[see also Article 122 (a) of
the Kerala Financial Code.]

†(viii) When a contingent charge exceeding  ` 1,000 is payable to a
firm of suppliers, a single party etc., separate contingent bill shall ordinarily be
prepared  for  the  amount  and  endorsed  for  payment  by  Reserve  Bank
Remittances drafts in cases in which the drawing officer concerned is attached
to a banking treasury or a treasury having currency chest facility. Where the
drawing officer is attached to a non-banking treasury without currency chest,
the bill for the contingent charges above  ` 1,000 shall be drawn in cash from
the non-banking treasury and disbursed to the payee in cash or by money
order or by Bank Draft at the expense of the payee. When payment is made by
draft, the draft as and when obtained shall be forwarded to the payee. ‡A
proper receipt for the amount should be obtained from the party/firm concerned
and retained by the drawing and disbursing officer.

*A  proper  receipt  for  the  amount  should  be  obtained  from  the  party
concerned. If the amount involved is above  `100 the receipt should be forwarded
to the Accountant General. After effecting payment a certificate to the effect that
the payment has been made to the proper person and that a proper acknowledgment

return the duplicate copy of the advice with the date of payment to the drawing
officer after payment is made.

Where  the  endorsee  wishes  to  collect  payment  on  the  bill  through  a
messenger (other than a banker) the messenger must produce a letter of authority
in Form T.R. 103. †The letter of authority should be preserved in non-banking

RULES  198-200

198. Statement of amounts due to the Government by a local body.—
Any amount due to the Government by a local body, including an amount due
on account of a loan which it has taken from the Government shall, if it remains
unpaid be subject to recovery by adjustment from grants payable to it by the
Government other than those payable under the provisions of a statute.

A statement showing all the amounts due to the Government by the local
body  and  remaining  unpaid  shall  be  presented  at  the  treasury  along  with
every bill on which a local body claims payment of a non statutory grant-in-
aid. Out of the grant payable to the local body, the Treasury Officer shall
credit to Government the amount shown in the statement of amounts due by
it or the whole of the grant, whichever is less, and he shall credit the local
body’s account only with the balance of the grant, if any. The treasury shall
send the statements of amounts due by local bodies prescribed above to the
Accountant General along with the bills.

199. Compensation awarded by courts out of fines to injured parties.—
When a court orders the payment to an injured party of an amount kept in
deposit in the treasury which was awarded to him as compensation out of a
fine imposed in criminal case, it shall certify on the order either—

(1)

that the sentence and award have been confirmed by the appellate
court and no order has been received from the court of revision reversing or
modifying the order of compensation, or

(2) when the order as to compensation has been modified in appeal
or revision, that the payment ordered is in conformity with such modification,
or

(3)

that the appeal time has expired and no appeal has been preferred,
and that no order has been received from the court of revision reversing or
modifying the order of compensation.

200. Refunds of revenue.—Bills for drawing moneys from the treasury
on account of refunds of revenue shall be prepared in Form T.R. 65 unless
some other form has been prescribed in regard to any particular class of such
refunds. Every refund shall be noted against the original receipt entry in the
departmental accounts. The government servant who is responsible for the
maintenance of the departmental accounts containing the original receipt entry
shall  certify  on  the  bill  that  the  refund  has  been  so  noted  and  shall  fill  in
columns (1) to (5) of the Form. The Treasury or Sub Treasury Officer shall not

RULE  200

pay any such bill unless particulars of the order of sanction of a competent
authority are furnished on the voucher and a certified copy of the order is
attached to it if no copy is separately communicated to the Accountant General.

A government servant who draws a bill for a refund of revenue shall
certify on the bill that the restrictions prescribed by the Government in regard
to time limits for claims for refunds (See Article 44 of the Kerala Financial
Code) have not been contravened. The certificate shall be in that one of the
alternative forms provided for the purpose in the form of refund bill (Form
T.R. 65) that is appropriate in each case. When he is himself the sanctioning
authority, he shall also certify on the bill that the refund claimed satisfies
the conditions, if any, prescribed in the departmental rules and administrative
orders; in other cases, this certificate shall be furnished by the competent
authority in the order of sanction.

Unlike  sub-vouchers  for  contingent  charges,  sub-vouchers  relating
refunds  of  revenue  shall  not  be  cancelled.  The  Treasury  or  other  Officer,
who disburses the amounts by money order or otherwise, shall forward to
the Accountant General for audit all sub-vouchers, however small the amount
involved. The Secretary, Kerala Public Service Commission, however, shall,
in respect of the amounts drawn by him from the District Treasury, Trivandrum
for  remittance  by  money  order  to  the  parties,  send  only  a  certificate  of
disbursement to the Accountant General retaining the money order receipts
with him.

NOTE 1—Refunds of land revenue.—Revenue Inspectors are required to
make  refunds  of  land  revenue,  when  necessary,  during  their
tours. Each Revenue Inspector should estimate the amount that
he is likely to require for the purpose each month and apply to
the  Tahsildar  for  the  necessary  funds.  The  Tahsildar  should
check the amount with the published list of excess collections
that the Divisional Officer has authorised him to refund, draw
the required amount on a bill containing details of the items
included and send it to the Revenue Inspector. The Revenue
Inspector should submit the receipts obtained from the payees
to the Tahsildar, who should attach them to the bill submitted to
the Treasury Officer in support of the charge in the sub treasury
account.  The  Revenue  Inspector  should  refund  to  the  sub
treasury by the date of closing its monthly account any part of

162

PART  V

RULE  200

the amount drawn and sent to him that he has not disbursed
and any amount that he so refunds should be deducted at the
foot of the refund voucher on which the amount was originally
drawn.

Jamabandi Officers are also required to make such refunds, when
necessary,  and  should  obtain  the  amount  required  from  the
Tahsildar concerned. The Tahsildar should draw a sum equal to
the excess collections to be refunded in respect of the villages
to be dealt with at each Jamabandi camp and hand it over to the
Jamabandi  Officer  before  he  starts  work  at  the  camp.  The
Jamabandi Officer should make the refunds to claimants who
are present at the camp and return any undisbursed balance to
the Tahsildar together with the payees’ receipts before leaving
the camp.

NOTE 2—Refunds on account of stamp.—When a refund has to be made
on  account  of  spoilt  or  damaged  stamps  (other  than  stamps
received back from a vendor), the Tahsildar should draw a bill
in Form T.R. 66 and obtain the payee’s receipt on it.

If the order of sanction of the competent authority is not recorded
on the bill itself, a certified copy of the order should be attached
to the bill.

NOTE 3—Refunds of process and poundage fees by courts of law.—Refunds
of process and poundage fees should be treated as refunds, of
stamp  revenue.  The  court  should  make  such  refunds,  when
necessary, from its permanent advance and recoup its permanent
advance  by  drawing  a  contingent  bill  headed  “Refund  of
process and poundage fees” on the treasury at the end of each
month. It should attach to every such bill at the relevant refund
vouchers in the form prescribed by the High Court containing
the signatures of the payees in token of having received the
amounts refunded.

When  a  refund  has  to  be  made  after  a  process  has  been
transmitted for service from one court to another, the refund
order  should  be  forwarded  for  payment  to  the  Judge  of  the
court in which the process fees have been deposited.

RULE  200

NOTE 4—Refunds of registration fees.—A registering officer should make
refunds of registration fees, when necessary, from his permanent
advance  and  recoup  his  permanent  advance  by  drawing  a
contingent bill headed “Refund of registration fees” on the treasury.
He should attach to every such bill all the relevant refund vouchers
in Form T.R. 65 containing the signatures of the payees in token of
having received the amounts refunded.

NOTE 5—Refunds of excess receipts on account of advertisements in the
Gazette and other official publication.—The Superintendent,
Government Press, should meet in the first instance from his
permanent advance refunds of excess receipts on account of
advertisements  in  the  Kerala  Gazette  and  other  official
publications, and subsequently recoup the permanent advance
by presenting bills at the District Treasury, Trivandrum. These
bills should be supported by money order acknowledgments of
the parties concerned.

NOTE 6—Refunds of college and examination fees.—When any college
fees have to be refunded under the rules and orders in force,
the Principal of the College should draw a bill for the amount to
be  refunded,  attach  to  it  the  order  of  a  competent  authority
sanctioning the refund and present it at the treasury for payment.

If an examination fee or a part of such fee has to be refunded,
the government servant who received the fee (the Secretary,
Kerala Public Service Commission, or the Commissioner for
Government Examinations or the Text Book Officer) should
endorse a certificate on the original receipt for the fee, specifying
the amount to be refunded. The person who paid the fee should
present  the  receipt  so  endorsed  for  payment  at  the  treasury
which issued the receipt.

                           When the fees payable by more than one candidate in a school
have been remitted into the treasury in a lumpsum and a single
collective  receipt  issued  and  a  part  of  the  amount  has  to  be
refunded, the procedure laid down in Rule 200 above should be
followed.

NOTE 7—Refunds of fines.—When a appellate court or court of revision,
other than the High Court, reverses or reduces a sentence of

164

RULES  200-201

fine  on  appeal,  it  should  issue  a  refund  order  in  the  form
prescribed by the High Court.

                         When the High Court reverses or reduces a sentence of fine the
court which passed the original sentence should issue a refund
order on receiving the High Court’s certificate under section
425 and 442 of the Code of criminal Procedure in regard to its
order on appeal or in revision.

NOTE 8—Refunds of salestax and agricultural income-tax.—Refund of sales
tax and agricultural income-tax shall be claimed in Form 49 of Kerala
General Salestax Rules and the form prescribed in rule 32 A of the
Agricultural Income Tax Rules, respectively. When a refund is
sanctioned,  the  assessing  authority  concerned,  shall  forward  a
refund order in the relevant form mentioned above, to the party
concerned, simultaneously giving due intimation to the Treasury
Officer regarding the issue of refund order. The refund order shall
be made payable only at the treasury in which the original credits
have been made. The Treasury Officer shall verify the original
credits noted in the refund order and put his initials in the column
provided for the purpose in the refund order, as token of having
checked them. The refund order shall be passed for payment, only
after verification of the credits, as mentioned above.

201. Loans and advances.—Particulars of the order sanctioning the loan
or advance shall be furnished in every bill or other document on which a loan or
advance is drawn.

In  the  case  of  a  loan  sanctioned  to  fully  owned  Government  Company/
Corporation, a written undertaking in the form prescribed by the Government in
that behalf should be got executed before the loan is actually disbursed. A certificate
that the written undertaking has been obtained from the loanee should be recorded
by the countersigning authority on the bill for the drawal of the amount of the
loan. In cases where the bills for drawal of loan amounts are not required to be
countersigned  by  the  sanctioning  authority,  the  following  procedure  shall  be
followed  in  regard  to  furnishing/execution  of  the  undertaking  by  the  loanee
institutions.

The sanction should specifically state that the undertakings/agreement would
be furnished executed by the loanee before the drawal of the amount of loan. It
should also include a clause that the Accountant General/Disbursing Officer

165

PART  V

RULE  201

would  authorise  payment  only  on  the  receipt  of  a  certificate  from  the
sanctioning authority that the undertaking/agreement has been obtained from
the  loanee.  The  sanctioning  authority  should  ensure  that  the  requisite
certificate is furnished to the Accountant General/Disbursing Officer as soon
as the undertaking/agreement is received from the loanee, so that payment
of money is not unduly delayed.The sanction of a competent authority to a
personal  advance  may,  if  preferred,  be  obtained  in  the  form  of
countersignature on the bill itself before it is presented at the treasury, instead
of in a separate order.

The treasury shall not pay a bill for an advance under the head “Advances
to cultivators” (See Article 246 of the Kerala Financial Code) unless it is signed by
an officer who has power to sanction the advance. If it is presented at the treasury
duly signed together with the borrower’s receipt for the amount of the advance,
duly stamped when necessary, the treasury shall pay the amount direct to the
borrower or his duly authorised agent. As an alternative, an officer who has to
disburse advances may draw on his own receipt on an abstract bill such portion
of the amount of the sanctioned advances awaiting disbursement as he is likely to
require for payment to the borrowers during his tours. When this latter alternative
is adopted, the Collector shall prescribe for each officer concerned, with due
regard to the circumstances, a maximum amount which he may draw on such an
abstract bill, and the following rules shall be observed:-

(1) No  disbursing  officer  shall  cash  another  abstract  bill,  before
furnishing a detailed bill to account for the disbursements from the amount
drawn on the last abstract bill and refunding into the treasury any balance
remaining undisbursed. A disbursing officer who cashes an abstract bill shall
under no circumstances delay the submission of the corresponding detailed
bill beyond the end of the second month following that in which he cashed
the abstract bill.

(2) The disbursing officer shall take the receipts of the borrowers
or their duly authorised agents on the spot when he disburses the advances
and shall certify at the foot of the detailed bill that all the advances included in
it were paid in his presence.

(3) The  Collector  shall  retain  the  borrowers’  receipts  and  after
checking the detailed bill with them, shall forward it to the Accountant General
through the Treasury Officer in support of the debits appearing in the treasury
account.

RULES  200-204

NOTE— In  the  case  of  advances  granted  to  cultivators  by  officers  of
departments other than Revenue, the Government may, by special
order, entrust the duties of the Collector under the above rule, to
the district heads of the departments concerned. In the absence of
any such special order, such duties shall be done by the Collector
of  the  District  in  respect  of  ‘advances  to  cultivators’  granted  by
officers  of  other  departments  also.

202. Survey Department Bills.—Bills for temporary advances sanctioned
for survey parties for demarcation purposes shall show the state of the advance
for which a statement showing the amount drawn up-to-date, the amount covered
by recovery lists advised to the Collector and the balance available should be
attached to each bill. Bills for amounts due to contractors for survey stones and
other  charges  recoverable  from  ryots  shall  be  in  the  forms  prescribed  in  the
departmental manuals or orders. No bill for an amount due to a contractor for
survey stones shall be paid, unless both the contractor and the survey officer-in-
charge of the survey party have signed it and the survey officer has certified on it
that the stones bought for use as survey marks have been brought into the stock
registers and the necessary notes regarding payment made in order to prevent
payment of any second claim on the same account.

203. Bills  for  survey  charges  in  the  Revenue  Department.—The
Tahsildar shall, when necessary, draw bills for advances for replacing missing
boundary marks in the form prescribed in the Standing Orders of the Board of
Revenue and shall attach to each bill for the cost of survey stones both the
contractor’s receipt for the amount and the acknowledgment of the village
officer  who  took  charge  of  the  stones.  They  shall  prepare  the  necessary
bills in due course for adjusting these charges in the manner laid down by
the Government and shall certify on each such bill that the amount charged
to the Government under cost of survey marks has been checked and found
to  be  correct.

204. Repayment of deposits.—Every order issued by a court or other
authority for the repayment of a deposit from a treasury shall be in English.
The order of a court or other authority for the repayment of a deposit and
the voucher for such repayment shall be in Form T.R. 67 except when some
other  form  has  been  specially  prescribed  for  the  purpose  for  any  class  of
deposits. When only a part of a rupee is to be repaid, the space against the
words “rupees” shall be scored through or the word “nil” shall be written in it,
in order to prevent interpolation. As a safeguard against fraud, the authority

ordering the repayment has been made against the original entry in the check
register.

Deposits, the detailed accounts of which are not kept at the treasury and
which are credited to the Government under Article 296 of the Kerala Financial
Code, Volume I, cannot be repaid without the sanction of the Accountant General
who will authorize payment on ascertaining that the item was really received and
was carried to the credit of Government as lapsed and that the claimant’s identity
and title to the money are certified by the Officer signing the application for
refund.

*Deposits,  the  detailed  accounts  of  which  are  kept  at  the  treasuries  and
which are credited to the Government under Article 296 of Kerala Financial Code,
Volume I, may be refunded without the sanction of the Accountant General. The
Treasury Officer shall before authorising refund in such cases, ascertain that the
item was really received and is traceable in his records was carried to the credit of
Government as lapsed and was not paid previously and that the claimant’s identity
and title to the money are certified by the officer signing the application for refund.

205. Repayment of revenue deposits.—

(a) A revenue deposit should only be repaid on an order of the court or
authority which ordered the acceptance of the deposit. When an earnest money
deposit has to be repaid, the departmental government servant in whose favour
the  amount  was  deposited,  should  endorse  a  repayment  order  on  the  receipt
which the treasury issued when receiving the deposit. When, however, he decides
that  the  deposit  should  be  credited  to  the  Government,  he  should  return  the
receipt to the treasury with an order endorsed on it for payment by transfer to the
appropriate head of account.

(b) When an earnest money deposit made by intending tenderer in
another  State  has  to  be  repaid,  the  departmental  officer  concerned  should
arrange for the repayment through the Accountant General and for this purpose
he should forward to the Accountant General the original deposit receipt of
the Treasury Officer with the refund order duly endorsed thereon.

(c) When  a  deposit  is  to  be  transferred  to  another  head  of  account
whether at the district treasury or at a sub treasury, the government servant who
ordered the acceptance of the deposit should prepare and sign a voucher in Form

206. Repayment of civil courts deposits.—

(a) At  stations  where  the  treasury  does  not  transact  its  cash
business through the Bank.—A person who claims that any moneys are due
to him from a court should present a receipt for the amount to the court with
his application. If the claim is in order, the court should issue an order to the
treasury for the payment in Form T.R. 70 specifying the date on which the
order is issued, the amount to be paid and the account to which the payment
is debited. The receipt taken from a party for a sum paid out of the court
should, when filed in the court, be attached by gum to the office counterfoil
of the original order book.

The claimant should present the order at the treasury in the account
month in which it is issued or, if he fails to do so, should return it to the court,
which may re-issue it after the presiding Judge has re-dated it and initialed the
correction.  When  an  order  is  thus  re-dated  and  re-issued,  the  further  date
should be entered in the office counterfoil of the original order book.

(b) At stations where the treasury transacts its cash business through
the bank.—The procedure for obtaining payment of moneys due from these
courts is the same as that described in the preceding clause, except that the
court should compare the application with the entry in the register of receipts
and verify that the balance in deposit is sufficient to meet the payment before
issuing an order on the bank for payment of the amount and that the order
should be issued in Form T.R. 71.

(c) At stations where there is no treasury or where the treasury is
located at a great distance from the court.— The civil court should refund
the moneys claimed from the permanent advance and recoup the permanent
advance later by drawing contingent bills on the treasury, supported by the
relevant individual deposit repayment vouchers duly completed.

207. Repayment of revenue deposits and criminal court’s deposits.—
An  entry  should  be  made  on  every  order  for  the  repayment  of  a  revenue
deposit or a criminal court deposit stating that no payment will be made on it
after the close of the financial year in which it is issued or three months from
the date of issue, whichever is earlier.

RULE  208

208. Repayment  of  personal  deposits.—The  treasury  should  make
payments only on cheques taken from a cheque book issued by the treasury,
signed  by  the  responsible  administrators  of  the  personal  deposit  account  and
presented  within  three  months  from  the  date  of  issue.  The  Treasury  or  Sub
Treasury Officer, as the case may be, should see that no payment is made on any
cheque unless the balance in hand is sufficient to meet it. As a rule, the responsible
administrator of each personal deposit account should have a drawing account
with, and draw cheques, on either a district treasury only or any one sub treasury
only. The  Government  will  specify  the  treasury  or  sub  treasury  on  which  he
should draw cheques in the order sanctioning the opening of the personal deposit
account. If an administrator has to carry out transaction in more than one district,
Government may permit him to have a personal deposit account in each of them.
When a personal deposit account relates to an estate which has dealings with
more than one sub treasury in a district, its drawing account should be with the
district treasury only and Government drafts or cash orders should be obtained
for payments to be made at sub treasuries [See Rule 213 (a) below]. If an estate, the
drawing account of which is kept at a sub treasury, requires occasionally to have
payments made at the district treasury, the Treasury Officer may make the payments
and adjust them in his accounts for the estate; he should inform the Sub Treasury
Officer at once of any such payment, so that the necessary entries may be made
in the personal deposit account of the estate.

NOTE 2—If a government servant attaches an estate or part of an estate he
is  the  “responsible  administrator”  of  it  and  should  sign  the
cheques relating to it. If, however, the attaching officer is the
District  Collector  it  is  permissible  for  him  to  delegate  this
power to a Revenue Divisional Officer, if he wishes; if he does
so, he should inform the Treasury Officer and the Accountant
General at once.

NOTE 3—*When a prohibitory order is received from a Court attaching a
certain amount from a personal deposit account maintained in
the Treasury, the Treasury Officer shall withdraw the said sum
including  M.O.  commission,  if  necessary,  from  the  personal
deposit account concerned by presenting a bill in form T.R. 42
duly signed by him and arrange remittance of the amount to the
Court concerned in the usual manner. The Treasury Officer shall
intimate the Administrator of the personal deposit account as
and when the attachment order is effected.

NOTE 5—When a personal deposit account is opened in the Treasury with
reference to Note 2 under Rule 93 of these Rules the head of the
institution concerned (Principal of the College or a similar head
of  a  post-matric  institution  other  than  a  college)  is  the
“responsible Administrator” of that account. If the institution
is situated at the headquarters of a district or anywhere in the
taluk in which the district headquarters is located the drawing
account shall be in the District Treasury and in other cases the
drawing account shall be in the sub treasury at the headquarters
of the taluk in which the institution is situated unless specifically
ordered otherwise by the Director of Treasuries.

NOTE 6—The administrator of each personal ledger account shall furnish
to the Treasury Officer, at the close of each financial year, a
certificate of acceptance of the closing balance as worked out
in the Treasury Accounts, after reconciling differences, if any,
between  the  Treasury  Accounts,  and  the  Administrator’s
Accounts. The Treasury Officer shall not permit withdrawals
from the Personal Deposit Account after 31st May of any year
unless and until the closing balance certificate in respect of the
previous financial year has been received by him.

209. Special  to  the  Forest  Department.—In  the  Forest  Department
only  the  Divisional  Forest  Officer  has  power  to  order  the  payment  of  an
earnest money deposit. He should do so, when necessary by endorsing his
orders on the treasury receipt. No such deposit should ever be repaid in part
leaving a balance still in deposit.

TREASURIES  WHICH  DO  NOT  TRANSACT  THEIR  CASH  BUSINESS
THROUGH  THE  BANK

A.  District Treasuries

(1)

210.

A bill or other documents presented for payment at a District
Treasury shall be received and scrutinized in the Accounts Department and
then placed before the Treasury Officer. If he is satisfied that the claim is
admissible, the authority good, the signature genuine and in order, and the
receipt a valid discharge, the Treasury Officer shall sign and order for payment
at the foot of the bill, or other document. After the bill, or other document has
been completely entered in the accounts and Treasury Officer has signed the
order to pay, it shall be sent to the treasurer’s Department and the payee shall
be directed to the Treasurer’s counter. The Treasurer shall make the payment
and enter it in his account, which is a cash book (without subsidiary registers)
in  which  each  cash  transaction  is  posted  as  it  occurs.  The  Treasurer  shall
punch the stamp, if any, affixed to the payees receipt, stamp the document
‘paid’ and retain it for delivery of the Accounts Department when the books
are compared. All bills and other documents passed for payment on any day
shall be paid on the same day and no payment shall be made otherwise than in
accordance with a written order of the Treasury Officer.

NOTE  1—In treasuries where the “token system” has been introduced the
instructions  issued  in  that  regard  should  be  strictly  adhered
to.

NOTE 2—*In  respect  of  treasury  savings  bank  cheques  presented  for
encashment, the Treasury Officer or the Officer authorised for
the purpose will examine the cheque and the amount thereof
and after satisfying himself that the claim is admissible, affix
rubber stamp “Pay Cash” on the face of the cheque and put his
dated signature in token of his order of payment. Necessary
entries regarding the amount withdrawn will be made in the
savings bank ledger account and the cash scroll simultaneously
by the Officer who passes the cheque. When the payment is

made by the Treasurer, he will affix rubber stamp “Cash Paid”
and  affix  his  dated  signature  in  the  cheque  after  passing
necessary entries in his cash book.

NOTE 3—**  Bills  sent  to  Treasuries  through  messengers  should  be
endorsed by the drawing officer in the name of messengers.
The  signature  of  the  messenger  shall  be  taken  on  the  bill
itself,—

(i)

in the drawing office, when it is endorsed in the messengers

name, duly identified and attested by the drawing officer;

(ii) at the Treasury Counter before payment is obtained, (In cases
where more than one bill is paid to a messenger at one and the same time it
is enough if the signature of the messenger is obtained in any one of the bill,
as the messenger’s signature is obtained for the purpose of identification of
the payee only);

(iii) the messenger should acknowledge receipt of the bill amount

and discharge the claim before token is obtained from the Treasury.

(2)

   In checking bills and making payments, the Treasury Officer

shall observe the following rules:—

(a) The  Treasury  Officer  shall  not  make  any  payment  without
obtaining adequate information as to its nature, and shall not accept any bill
or other document which does not formally present this information, unless
there  are  valid  reasons,  which  he  shall  record  in  writing,  for  not  insisting
that the information be shown in the bill or other document (See Rule 21,
Part I of these Rules). He shall make sure, that he will be in a position to
satisfy the Accountant General that the claim made in every bill that he pays
is valid and to prove to him that the payee actually received the amount of the
bill. He shall also check carefully, that the rules regarding the completion of
vouchers and the endorsements on bills have been observed.

(b) Before paying a bill on the authority of an order purporting to
have been issued by the office of the Accountant General, the Treasury Officer
shall, in addition to checking the bill in the usual manner, verify the signature
on that order by comparison with the specimen signature of the signing officer
furnished to him by the Accountant General.

PART  V

RULE  210

A  bill  *pre-checked  or  passed  by  the Accountant  General  and
enfaced  for  payment  at  a  Treasury  or  an  authorisation  issued  by  the
Accountant General for non-recurring payments due to a gazetted government
servant such as fees, honoraria, etc., should not be paid if it is presented at the
treasury three months after the date of enfacement or authorisation as the
case may be: Such bills or authorisations for payments debitable to traveling
allowance, contingencies, grant-in-aid scholarships, stipend etc., passed for
payment and issued in one financial year shall not be paid after the close of
that year evenif three months have not elapsed since the date of enfacement/
authorisation. In all such cases where the period of validity, is over, the bills/
authorisations should be returned to the Accountant General by the Treasury
Officer with a non payment certificate for cancellation of the enfacement/
authorization,  if  fresh  sanction  or  allotment  of  funds  is  necessary  or  for
revalidation of the *pre-checked enfacement/authorisation as the case may
be, by the Accountant General.

*This amendment shall be deemed to have come into force on 17th

day of April, 1986.

(c) The Treasury Officer shall not accept any document bearing
an erasure. He shall return any bill, or other document bearing an erasure
and inform the drawer that he may present a fresh one. If documents bearing
erasures are received frequently from any office the Treasury Officer shall
bring the fact to the notice of the head of that office.

(d) The Treasury Officer shall correct any arithmetical inaccuracy
or obvious mistakes in a bill, presented to him for payment, but shall intimate
to  the  Drawing  Officer  at  once  any  correction  which  he  makes  (See  Rule
22, Part I of these Rules).  Similarly when a bill contains any inadmissible
or doubtful item which can easily be eliminated, the Treasury Officer shall
disallow it, pay the reminder of the bill, give the person who presented the
bill a memorandum containing details of the disallowance and the reasons for
making it, and attach a copy of the memorandum to the bills. When there is a
change  in  the  office  or  rate  of  pay  of  a  gazetted  government  servant,  the
Treasury Officer shall check the bill, in which the new rate of pay is first
claimed with reference to the order directing the change, before he passes it.
When the special authority of the Accountant General is required under rule
175 above for passing an increment, the Treasury Officer shall not pay the
increment, unless an increment certificate approved by the Accountant General
or by an authorised assistant on his behalf is attached to the bill.

PART  V

RULE  210

Treasury Officer shall check the correctness of any deduction made
in a bill with reference to the Indian Civil Service Family Pension Regulations
or the Superior Service (India) Family Pension Fund Rules.

NOTE— Every treasury should keep a register in Form T.R. 72 showing the
names of all gazetted government servants who draw their pay from
it. As  soon  as  each  pay  slip  issued  by  the Accountant  General  is
received, the amount stated in it should be entered against the name
of the government servant concerned. Whenever the pay bill of a
gazetted  government  servant  is  presented  for  payment,  reference
should  be  made  to  this  register  to  see  that  the  rate  claimed  does
not  exceed  the  sanctioned  rate.  Whenever  last  pay  certificate  is
issued  to  a  gazetted  government  servant,  the  word  “nil”  together
with the date from which payment at the treasury has ceased should
be written in the money column of the register against his name and
the number and date of the last pay certificate should be quoted.
Every entry made in this register should be submitted immediately
to the Treasury Officer for attestation by his dated initials.

$(e) The Treasury Officer shall use a book of counterfoil forms in
Form TR 73 for communicating to drawing officers objections raised in the
course of pre-audit of bills and other claims.  Such objections shall not be
written as endorsement on the bills themselves.  A list of objections that are
commonly found  necessary to be raised in the course of pre-audit of bills and
other claims is furnished in Appendix 27.

When a bill or other claim is to be objected, the relevant item of
objection  in Appendix  27  should  be  fully  written  up  in  the  original  and
counterfoil of Form TR. 73 in the blank space above the space for signature of
the Treasury Officer.  The list in Appendix  27, is not exhaustive.  If the objection
to be raised is one not included in Appendix 27 that may also be written fully
with  the  relevant  authority  for  the  objection  in  the  blank  space  above  the
space for the signature of the Treasury Officer.

(f)  When checking arrear claims, the Treasury Officer shall pay
special  attention  to  the  rules  laid  down  by  the  Government  in  regard  to
suchclaims (See Articles 61 to 68 of the Kerala Financial Code).

RULE  210

(g) When  an  endorsement  or  re-endorsement  on  a  bill  is
unauthorised, incomplete or otherwise irregular [See Rule 163 (p), 166, 167 and
clause (c) of this rule] the Treasury Officer shall refuse payment and return
the bill to the person who presented it with a memorandum explaining why
payment is refused.

(h) The Treasury Officer shall on no account pay any abstract bill
for contingent expenditure requiring countersignature after payment, in which
the drawing officer should have furnished the certificate prescribed in the
sentence of rule 187 (d) but has not done so.

(i) When contingent bill endorsed in favour of a private party is
presented at the Treasury for payment, the Treasury Officer shall check the
particulars of the bill with the advice received from the drawing officer before
making payment. When a single claim for an amount of  `50 or more is included
in contingent bill for several items, the Treasury Officer may honour the bill
provided the drawing officer has recorded in the bill the special and exceptional
reasons for doing so. If the bill is in order and is paid, he shall make a note
accordingly on the advice and return the slip in Form T.R. 45 accompanying
the bill duly filled in.

The same procedure will apply in the case of bills for grants-in-aid,
scholarships, stipends and book allowances referred to in rule 188 (viii). After
payments is made, the Treasury Officer should return the duplicate copy of
the advice to the drawing officer noting therein the date of payment.

An endorsement on a contingent bill shall lapse three months after
the date of the endorsement, or at the end of the financial year, whichever is
earlier, and the Treasury Officer shall not pay an endorsed contingent bill if
the endorsement has lapsed.

(j) The Treasury Officer shall not pay any contingent bill for an
amount less than one rupee, except on the last working day of the month or
when the drawing officer is about to hand over charge.

(k) Before  paying  a  bill  for  overtime  fees  payable  out  of  fees
recovered  from  private  parties,  the  Treasury  Officer  shall  verify  that  the
prescribed fees have been realised and credited into the treasury and certify
to that effect on the bill, stating the amount of the fees realised and the item or
items in the accounts in which they were included.

(l) The  Treasury  Officer  shall  not  pay  any  bill  relating  to
scholarships or stipends, unless the sanctioning authority has communicated
to him the necessary sanction for the payment.

RULE  210

(m) The Treasury Officer shall not pay a bill for a loan or interest
bearing advances to gazetted and non-gazetted government servants unless
the claim is drawn or countersigned by the officer specified in the sanction
order and a certified copy of such sanction order is attached to the bill. The
signature of the departmental officer should be verified at the treasury before
the bill is passed for payment.

The Treasury Officer shall not pay a bill for a loan to fully owned
Government Company/Corporation unless the countersigning authority has
furnished a certificate on the bill to the effect that a written undertaking in
the form prescribed by the Government for the purpose has been obtained
from the loanee, or in cases where the bill is not required to be countersigned
by a departmental authority, unless the sanctioning authority has furnished
the above certificate separately to the Treasury Officer as required in Rule
201. However, if the bill for such a loan is presented at the Treasury on the
basis of an authorisation from the Accountant General, the furnishing of this
certificate need not be insisted by the Treasury Officer as in such cases, the
certificate  is  to  be  furnished  to  the Accountant  General  direct  and  the
authorisation will be issued by the Accountant General only on receipt of the
certificate.

(n) Before paying a Survey Department bill referred to Rule 202 the
Treasury Officer shall satisfy himself with reference to the statement attached
to the bill that the amount applied for can be met from the balance of the
advance standing to the credit of the survey party.

(o) The Treasury Officer shall make payment on a refund bill only
after verifying the credit for the original receipt by means of the particulars in
columns (4) and (5) of the bill (Form T.R. 65) affixing his signature in column (6)
in token of his having done so and certifying on the bill that the items included
in it have not been refunded previously.

(p) A deposit shall only be repaid under an order of the authority
which originally ordered the acceptance of the deposit and ordinarily, only on
the  appearance  of  the  person  entitled  to  it  and  on  his  furnishing  a  proper
receipt. A deposit not exceeding  ` 100 may however, be repaid by money
order under the rules applicable to refunds of revenue (See also Rule 216
below) on receipt of the order of the competent authority. The Treasury Officer
shall credit to the Government any deposit or balance of a deposit amounting
to less than fifty paise which is due for refund. If a valid claim for repayment is
subsequently received, the repayment shall be treated as a refund of revenue.

RULE  210

Exception—The limit of  ` 100 prescribed in the above rule for the issue
of money orders shall not apply to refunds of deposits made
under  the  Co-operative  Societies Act  and  to  surcharge  on
a stamp duty levied under section 71 of the Kerala Panchayat
Act,  1960  (Act  32  of  1960),  section  125  of  the  Kerala
Municipalities Act, 1960 (Act 14 of 1961), section 133 of the
Calicut City Municipal Act, 1961 (Act 30 of 1961), and the
orders in G.O.(Ms.) 101/62/DD, dated 15th February 1962.

(q) When a claim is presented for repayment of a revenue deposit,
the Treasury  Officer  shall  compare  the  refund  order  of  the  Court  or  other
authority,  which  directed  the  acceptance  of  the  original  deposit,  with  the
entry  in  the  register  of  receipts.  If  the  amount  in  deposit  is  sufficient,  he
shall take the payee’s receipt, make the payment and immediately record the
amount and the date of the repayment in the register of payments (Form T.A.
14 of the Kerala Account Code, Volume II) and also in the register of receipts.
If there is not a sufficient balance at the credit of the particular item to meet
the payment ordered, the Treasury Officer shall endorse that fact on the refund
order and return it to the person who presented it.

An earnest money deposit shall never be repaid in part.

(r) *Refund orders under Section 63, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70 or 71 of the
Kerala Court Fees and Suit Valuation Act, 1959 (Act 10 of 1960) shall be issued
to the party either in Form T.R. 65 or in Form No.70 of the Civil Rules of
Practice, Kerala. In all cases in which such refund is made in cash, a deduction
of seven paise for each rupee or fraction thereof shall be made, except in cases
when the refund pertains to any fee paid in pursuance of an order of court
which  has  been  varied  and  reversed  in  appeal.  The  authority  ordering  the
refund shall specify in the refund order in Form T.R. 65 or Form No. 70 of the
Civil Rules of Practice, Kerala, as the case may be, the amount if any, to be
deducted  at  seven  paise  per  rupee  or  fraction  thereof  and  the  net  amount
payable to the party. The refund order shall also contain the particulars of the
suit and the party should have signed the order in token of having received
payment before presentation of the order at the Treasury. Such orders can be
endorsed to a messenger who shall also receive the payment as aforesaid.
While making any such payment the Treasury Officer shall observe, with
special care, the precautions in rule 214 below in regard to payments to persons
not in Government service.

RULES  210-211

(s) The Treasury Officer shall not make payment on a refund order

that has lapsed under the rules (See Rules 206 and 207 above).

(t) The  procedure  in  regard  to  payment  of  interest  on  different
forms of Government securities shall be regulated by the rules and orders on
the subject contained in the Government Securities Manual and any other
rules or orders issued by the Government in this behalf.

(u) Letters of credit.—(1) Every payment made on the authority of
any letter of credit must be noted without fail, at the time of payment either in
the appropriate register of payments or on the reverse of the letter of credit.

(3) The Treasury Officer must bear in mind that the letter of credit
shows  the  maximum  amount  he  has  authority  to  pay  or  the  Departmental
Officer credited has authority to ask for and that any further payment is made
at the Treasury Officer’s own risk, the balance of credit after each payment
must therefore be so recorded that there can be no risk of over payment.

The Treasury Officer shall deduct from a bill for the pay,

who is permitted under Rule 169 above to draw his pay, etc., on bills in the
forms prescribed for gazetted Government servants) any amount attached by
a prohibitory order of a Court of Law. He shall remit to the proper courts, in
accordance with the procedure prescribed below, all amounts deducted from
the pay, etc., bills of government servants on account of court attachment
orders, whether deducted by himself or by the drawing officer. No such amounts
may be remitted to the court by cash order or Government draft.

*NOTE 1—If an order of attachment against a gazetted government servant
(or a non-gazetted government servant who is permitted under
rule 169 above, to draw his pay, etc., on bills in the form prescribed
for gazetted government servants) is received before a previous
order of attachment against the same government servant has
been fully complied with, the recoveries shall be made by the

reference to the attachment orders is within the maximum limits
prescribed in Article 102, Kerala Financial Code, Volume I.

NOTE 2—If the new attachment order has the result of increasing the amount
beyond the maximum limits prescribed, the Treasury Officer shall
return the attachment order to the Court concerned with a statement
showing—

(i) particulars of the existing attachment;

(ii) particulars  of  the  amount  withheld  and  paid  into  the  court
concerned  up-to-date  in  respect  of  the  existing  attachment;
and

(iii)

(a) the  balance  amount  available  to  be  recovered  after

effecting  the  existing  attachment.

(b) the actual attachable amount.

(1) When the court is located at the headquarters of the treasury which
cashes the bills.—The Treasury Officer shall clear the amounts deducted, once a
month, by payment to the court in cash. When making the payment, the Treasury
Officer shall send to the court a covering memorandum together with the original
advice list prepared by the drawing officer [See Rule 163 (j) above] for each
deduction made by a drawing officer and an advice list prepared by the treasury
for each deduction made by the Treasury Officer.

below:-

(i) When the Treasury Officer himself makes the deduction from a
bill, he shall prepare a money order form for the amount in favour of the court,
deduct the money order commission as well as the amount to be remitted from the
bill, pass the bill for the net amount and then send the money order form to the
post office for issue, furnishing a certificate that he has credited to the post office
by book transfer the amount of the money order together with the money order
commission due on it.

(ii) When  the  drawing  officer  has  made  the  necessary  deduction
from a bill under Rule 163 (j) above, the Treasury Officer shall credit the amount
deducted to the post office by transfer and send the money order form to the post
office for issue, furnishing a certificate as prescribed in sub-clause (i) above.
When he receives the receipt furnished by the post office for the money order, he

RULES  211-212

NOTE— A similar procedure shall be adopted in the case of attachment of
salary of a government servant under the provisions of the Revenue
Recovery Act.

(b) It is possible that a government servant whose emoluments have
been attached, may refrain from signing the acquittance roll and intentionally
allow  them  to  remain  undisbursed,  or  if  he  is  a  government  servant  who
draws his pay on a separate bill, may refrain from presenting his bill at the
treasury in order to evade or delay the recovery of an amount attached by a
court. If a Treasury Officer has received a court attachment order relating to
the emoluments of any government servant who draws his pay on a separate
bill and that government servant does not present his bill for pay due for the
previous month by the third working day of the month, the Treasury Officer
shall  at  once  bring  the  facts  to  the  notice  of  the  government  servant
immediately superior to the government servant whose emoluments have been
attached. When he considers it necessary in order to avoid delay in recovering
an amount attached by a court from the emoluments of a government servant
working under him, the head of the office, or, in the case of a government
servant who draws his pay on a separate bill, the administrative government
servants immediately superior to the government servant whose emoluments
have been attached, may draw the emoluments of the government servant
concerned  to  the  extent  to  which  they  have  been  attached,  subject  to  the
prescribed  restrictions and apply the amount so drawn in satisfaction of the
attachment order by remitting it to the court. The amount so drawn shall be
charged in the accounts, and the particulars of the attachment order shall be
entered in the acquittance roll or the bill, as the case may be, as an authority
for the charge. The money order receipts received from the courts shall be
filed with the attachment register.

Financial Code to record the details of prohibitory orders received
from courts and the recoveries effected by him in pursuance thereof.

day of April, 1986.

(c) The  last  payment  of  pay,  allowances,  etc.,  to  any  other
government  servant  in  any  of  the  circumstances  mentioned  in  clause  (a)
above, may be made in the same manner as the regular monthly pay, allowance,
etc.,  without  reference  to  the  departmental  authorities  and  the Accountant
General on the responsibility of the Head of the Office.
**Exception.—In  the  case  of  officers  in  the  cadre  of  Personal Assistant
to the District Educational Officers and above, the authority
to countersign the last salary bills shall vest with the Senior
Administrative Officer of the Office of the Director of Public
Instruction and in the case of officers in the cadre of Headmaster/
Assistant  Educational  Officer/Senior  Superintendent  and  of
those  having  identical  scales  of  pay  in  the  Department  the
authority  shall  vest  with  the  Deputy  Director  of  Education.

NOTE  1. —The term ‘government servant’ used in clause (c) includes a
non-gazetted  officer  who  draws  his  pay  and  allowances  on
salary bills countersigned by a gazetted officer in control over
him as mentioned in the exception to Rule 169 (b) and in his
case the responsibility for payment will be that of the gazetted
officer countersigning his salary bill.

NOTE  2. — When an amount found to be due to a government by a government
servant on any of the occasions mentioned in the previous clauses
represents (a) over payment of his pay, allowances or leave salary,
(b) house rent or postal and State Life Insurance premia due by
him, or (c) an outstanding balance in respect of any advance made
to him by the government, it shall be adjusted against the last pay
and allowances or leave salary due to him. If the amount due to the
government exceeds the amount payable to the government servant

as aforesaid the excess shall be recovered from his claim for death-
cum-retirement  gratuity  after  giving  the  officer  concerned  a
reasonable opportunity to explain [Vide Note 2 and Ruling No.25/
68 below rule (3) of Part III, K.S.R.]. If the amount proposed to
be  recovered  exceeds  the  death-cum-retirement  gratuity  the
excess over the death-cum-retirement gratuity, can be recovered
from the arrears of pension, if any, due to the officer if written
consent is obtained from him as pension (as distinct from death-
cum-retirement gratuity) enjoys the protection of the Pension
Act. A written consent is valid only to the extent it covers the
amount of pension earned by him till the date of such written
consent.  If  there  is  balance  still  to  be  recovered  from  the
government  servants  steps  shall  be  taken  to  proceed  against
him in a Court of Law unless the Executive Authority concerned
considers that it is not worthwhile to adopt that course.

NOTE  3. — The certificate from the Head of Department indicated in sub-
clause (a) above shall be in triplicate. The original copy shall
be sent to the Accountant General for safe custody along with
the  pension  papers  of  the  gazetted  government  employee
prepared by him; the duplicate shall be attached to the bill and
the triplicate filed by the Head of Department.

212 A. Claims  of  deceased  government  servants.—In  the  case  of
claims of a deceased government servant, on receipt of the claims for the
payment of arrears of pay and allowances from his/her heir/heirs the Head
of Office in which the government servant was last employed should draw
the amount in the appropriate bill form from the Treasury according as the
deceased  government  servant  held  a  gazetted  or  non-gazetted  post  at  the
time of his death. The claim should supported by all the relevant certificates
which  the  Head  of  the  Office  is  required  to  furnish  in  the  normal
circumstances. However in respect of the certificates which solely depend
on the personal knowledge of the government servant, but which obviously
cannot be furnished by the Head of the Office, the Head of Office should
record, if he is satisfied about the correctness of the claim, a certificate to the
effect  that  “the  claim  is  not  susceptible  of  verification;  but  is  considered
reasonable”. Further, as the claim would be the last one in respect the deceased
government servant, the requisite payment in the case of a government servant
whose pay is drawn on a gazetted government servant’s bill form, shall be

RULES  212A-213

made only after the Head of the Office has satisfied himself by reference to the
Accountant General, the Departmental authorities concerned if any, and his
own records that there are no demands outstanding against him. In the case
of other government servants, payment may be made without reference to the
Accountant General on the responsibility of the Head of the Office concerned.
The amount so withdrawn should be disbursed to the claimant or claimants
determined with due regard to the provisions of Article 95 of the Kerala Financial
Code, Volume I, after obtaining a formal receipt, stamped wherever necessary,
from the rightful claimant or claimants.

213. *(a) A Treasury Officer may issue either a draft or a cash order
for the purpose of defraying service expenditure from a Sub Treasury in his
district in exchange for properly prepared bills. In the case of non banking
Sub Treasuries, cash orders may also be issued in the following cases, namely:-

(1)

(2)

for the payment of collections of one court into another;

for  the  payment  of  land  acquisition  charges  (land
compensations)  originally  credited  under  Revenue  Deposit/
Work Deposit into the account of a court in another Sub Treasury
within the same District.

Sub Treasury Officers may accept remittances under the head of “Cash
Orders” under personal deposits, for the purposes mentioned above and grant
to  the  remitter  a  receipted  chalan  in  Form  T.R.  88A.  The  Sub  Treasury
Officer  shall  transmit  the  duplicate  chalan  to  the  District  Treasury  in  a
separate  cover  on  the  same  day  (not  with  the  daily  accounts)  for  the
disbursement of cash or for the issue of a cash order, as the case may be.
The District Treasury Officer, on receipt of the original chalans from the payer,
shall debit the item to “Personal Deposits”, “Cash Orders” and pass it for
payment of cash if it is payable at the District Treasury, or issue a cash order
if payable in another Sub Treasury.

The conditions under which a draft can be issued are explained in the
rule in Part VI of these Rules, one of which is that the minimum amount for
which a draft can be issued is `50 except in special circumstances, such as
family remittance in the case of Officers and men of the Police Department. For
amounts below this minimum, cash orders in Form No. T.R. 87 are to be issued
on any desired Sub Treasury within the district.

PART  V

RULE  213

Exception 1.—Cash orders may be issued even for sums over  `*50 in the
case of payments to be made at the Sub Treasuries which
have no currency chest facilities and cannot, therefore, act
as Treasury Agencies of the Reserve Bank of India and issue
drafts.

Exception 2.—Cash orders will be issued, irrespective of the amount and
whether the treasuries drawn on are banking or non-banking
with  or  without  currency  chest  facilities,  for  the  pay  and
allowances  for  the  non-gazetted  personnel  of  the  Police
Department.

Exception 3.—A cash order may be issued by a Treasury Officer in exchange
for a cheque drawn on the District Treasury by a Presiding
Officer of a Land Tribunal (in whose name a P.D. account
is maintained at the treasury) if so desired by the Presiding
Officer, irrespective of the amount involved, the nature of
the  Sub  Treasury  on  which  the  cash  order  is  drawn  (i.e.
banking  or  non-banking  with  or  without  currency  chest
facilities)  and  the  purpose  of  the  remittance.

The following rules shall be observed in connection with the issue of

cash orders:—

(i) When the Treasury Officer passes for payment a bill or other document
which is payable in full at a single Sub Treasury, he shall not issue a cash order,
but shall endorse the bill or other document for payment at the Sub Treasury. An
endorsement of this kind shall remain current, like a cash order for three months
only.

A cheque drawn by the administrator of an estate on his personal ledger
account at a District Treasury for an amount required at a Sub Treasury shall not,
however, be endorsed for payment at the Sub Treasury. The Treasury Officer
shall retain it, treating it as paid at the District Treasury, and issue a cash order on
the Sub Treasury.

(ii)  The Treasury Officer shall not issue a cash order for the remittance
of amounts due to private parties, such as decree amounts, costs, sale proceeds
of attached estates and the like. Such remittances are not in the interest of the
public service and shall, therefore, be made by postal money order at the expense
of the parties entitled to receive the amounts.

RULE  213

(iii) The Treasury Officer shall use cash order forms in the order of
the  numbers  printed  on  the  books,  and  shall  use  one  book,  at  a  time  for
issuing cash orders on all Sub Treasuries. He shall inform all Sub Treasuries
when he begins to use a fresh book. He shall have the orders issued on each
Sub Treasury numbered in separate annual series, and these numbers shall be
noted below the number of the book printed on cash order. Both the numbers
which appear on each cash order shall be quoted in the lists of paid orders
furnished to the Accountant General.

(iv) The directions laid down in Rule 253 below, regarding the custody
of cheque forms supplied for drawing cheques on treasuries shall apply also
to the custody of cash order forms.

(v) When a cash order is issued, the Treasury Officer shall assign
serial number to the order and enter the amount and other particulars in the
appropriate register prescribed in the Kerala Account Code, Volume II. An
advice in Form T.R. 88 shall then be sent by first post to the Sub Treasury
drawn  upon  and  the  cash  order  handed  over  to  the  person  tendering  the
money or the bill against which the order is issued.

(vi) On receipt of the advice of a cash order from the Treasury Officer,
the Sub Treasury Officer shall immediately enter the particulars in register in
Form T.A. VII of the Kerala Account Code, Volume II and when a cash order is
presented  the  advice  register  must  be  consulted  before  payment;  the  cash
order with the receipt endorsed will be the voucher for the payment, which
must be noted at the time in the advice register.

NOTE—The  adjustment  of  cash  order  will  be  watched  at  the  treasury  in
accordance with the directions contained in the Kerala Account Code,
Volume II.
(vii) A cash order shall lapse three months after the date of issue if not
cashed within that time. Payment of a lapsed cash order shall be stopped, and the
charges,  which  it  represent,  shall  be  cancelled  and  adjusted.  If  payment  is
subsequently claimed, the claimant shall be required to forward the lapsed cash
order to the Treasury Officer, who shall arrange for the payment and make a note
against the relevant entry in the cash order ledger Form T.A. 16 in the Kerala
Account Code, Volume II so as to prevent any possibility of making a second
payment.

PART  V

RULE  213

*NOTE—The following procedure shall be followed in the case of claims for

payment of a lapsed cash order:—

                  The original cash order shall be presented at the Treasury from which
it was issued by the Head of Office who drew the bill in payment of
which  the  cash  order  was  issued,  duly  endorsing  on  the  reverse
“Payment  received  in  cash”  or  a  fresh  cash  order  obtained
on……………….. Treasury as the case may be. The Treasury Officer
shall  treat  the  cash  order  as  voucher  and  pay  the  amount  to  the
officer either in cash or in the form of a fresh cash order as required
by the drawing officer. In both cases, the payment shall be debited in
the  treasury  accounts  under  the  service  head  debiting  which  the
original cash order was issued.

                 If payment is made in the form of a fresh cash order the amount shall
also  be  credited  simultaneously  under  “Personal  Deposit  Cash
Orders”. The original item which appeared in the statement of lapsed
cash orders referred to in Article 115, Kerala Account Code, Volume
II  and  the  month  of  cash  account  with  which  the  statement  was
forwarded to the Accountant General under Article 120 of Kerala
Account  Code  shall  be  quoted  on  the  lapsed  cash  orders  while
effecting payment in the above manner. For payment of a lapsed
cash  order  sanction  of  the Accountant  General  is  not  ordinarily
required. But, if payment is claimed after the period specified under
clause (a) of Article 53 of the Kerala Financial Code for the payment
of a claim without pre-audit from the date of issue of the cash order,
the claim shall be referred to the Accountant General for audit and
sanction.

(viii) When it is reported that a cash order has been lost or destroyed
within three months from the date of issue, the Treasury Officer shall follow the
procedure indicated in Rules 410 to 412 of Part VI of these Rules for the issue of
duplicate draft. If a duplicate cash order is issued, it shall lapse three months after
the date of issue of the original, if not cashed within that time.

(b) A Sub Treasury Officer shall not issue any cash order unless, for special
reason, he is authorised to issue cash orders in any case by a general or special
order of the Government. If, for special reasons, a Sub Treasury Officer is authorised
to issue cash orders on the District Treasury or any Sub Treasury in the same
district the procedure shall be the same as that prescribed for the District Treasury.

RULES  213-214

NOTE.—Cash orders for co-operative societies remittances may issue from
the District Treasury to the Sub Treasuries and vice versa and from
Sub Treasuries or other Sub Treasuries within the districts.

214. Payments to persons not in Government service.—When a person
not in government service claims payment for a service rendered or supply
made, the Treasury Officer shall observe the following rules:—

(a) He shall refuse payment, if the bill is not drawn or countersigned
by  the  Head  of  the  Department  or  other  responsible  government  servant,
under whose immediate order the service was rendered or the supply made
and shall inform the applicant for payment that he may either present a bill so
drawn or countersigned, or apply to the Accountant General for the issue of
an order for payment. If the bill is so drawn or countersigned but the Treasury
Officer considers that the authority of the drawing or countersigning officer is
not sufficient for making the payment he shall refuse payment and inform that
Officer that he may refer the matter to the Accountant General.

(b) He shall invariably take special precautions to satisfy himself as
to the identity of the applicant for payment in respect of any bill drawn by a
person who is not a government servant or drawn by a government servant
and endorsed for payment to a private party.

(c) When a bill endorsed for payment to a contractor or supplier is
re-endorsed by him in favour of a bank, the Treasury Officer shall not pay
the  bill,  unless  the  contractor  or  supplier  has  receipted  the  bill  and  also
signed a separate endorsement in favour of the bank.

NOTE— Payments due to contractors may, if so desired by them, be made to
their  Banks  instead  of  direct  to  contractors  provided  that,  the
department concerned obtains;

(1) an authorisation from the contractors in the form of a legally
valid document such as a power of attorney or transfer deed
conferring authority on the Bank to receive payment, and

(2)

the  contractor’s  own  acceptance  of  the  correctness  of  the
account made out as being due to him by Government or his
signature on the bill or other claim preferred against Government
before the settlement of the account or claim by payment to the
said Bank. While the receipt given by the Bank will constitute a
full and sufficient discharge for the payment, contractor should,
wherever possible, be induced to present their bill duly receipted
and charged through their Bankers.

      RULES  214-218

Nothing herein contained should operate to create in favour of the bank

any right or equity vis-à-vis the Government.

215. Payment of pensions.—The procedure to be followed by treasuries

in paying pensions is detailed in the rules in Section IV of this part.

216. (a) Payment  of  endorsed  bills.—When  a  bill  is  endorsed  or
endorsed and re-endorsed strictly in accordance with the provisions of Rule
163 (q) above, and the payment is duly made to the person specified in the
endorsement  or  re-endorsement  and  his  signature  duly  taken  in
acknowledgment of the payment, the drawing officer’s signature on the bill is
a valid discharge.

(b) Payment  by  postal  money  order.—When  the  drawing  officer
desires that the whole or part of the amount of a bill, other than a bill relating
to the claims of Government servants be sent to some other person by postal
money order and has made the necessary deductions in the bill, the Treasury
Officer  should  pass  the  bill  for  the  net  amount,  credit  the  deductions  by
transfer to the Post Office and send the money order form to the Post Office
with a certificate stating that he has credited the amount of the money order
with the commission due on it to the Post Office by book transfer. He should
obtain  an  individual  receipt  from  the  Post  Office  in  respect  of  each  such
money order, check it with the amount deducted from the bill and transmit it
to the drawing officer for record.

217. When the Government have authorised the head of an office to
send bills of specified kind to the treasury by post the Treasury Officer should
remit to the drawing officer by postal money order the amount passed for
payment (less the money order commission) in respect of each such bill duly
sent  to  the  treasury,  and  should  treat  the  money  order  commission  as  a
contingent charge of the drawing officer.

218. Refunds  of  revenue  and  deposits.—The  Treasury  Officer  or
other disbursing officer concerned should observe the following directions in
regard to amounts not exceeding  `100 due for refund from revenue or from
deposits:-

(i) Subject to the exceptions described in direction (ii) below, the
Treasury Officer or other disbursing officer concerned should remit to the
person entitled to the refund any amount not exceeding `100 that is due for
refund  by  postal  money  order  at  the  expense  of  the  payee  on  receipt  of  a
refund order passed by the competent authority, without any avoidable delay,

190

PART  V

RULE  218

and, in any case, within one month from the date of the refund order, without
waiting for an application from the payee.

In rare cases, where he feels that it would be risky to send the amount
straight away to the person entitled to it by postal money order, the Treasury
Officer or other disbursing officer may issue a notice inviting the payee to
appear and receive payment in person at the treasury or other office concerned,
and inform him that, if he fails to appear within one month (or such longer
period as may, when necessary, be specified), the amount to be refunded will
be remitted to him by postal money order at his expense.

(ii)    Any amount not exceeding 12 P. which is due for refund and any
amount exceeding 12 P. which is due for refund and is payable to several
parties in sums not exceeding 12 P. each should be credited to the Government.
Any amount exceeding 12 P. but not exceeding 50 P. which is due for refund
and any amount exceeding 50 P. which is due for refund and is payable to
several parties in sums not exceeding 50 P. each (and not all below 12 P.)
should remain credited to the Government unless a claim is preferred by the
person entitled to the refund, in which case the amount to be refunded to him
should be sent to him by postal money order at his expense unless he appears
in person to make his claim and takes payment in person.

(iii) When the Treasury Officer sends an amount by postal money
order with reference to these directions, he should follow the procedure laid
down in Rule 216 (b) above for sending money orders. He should state briefly
the purpose of the remittance in the acknowledgment portion of the money
order form in continuation of the printed entry  “ Received the sum specified
on the reverse on ………………………………….” leaving sufficient space
below this manuscript entry for the payees’ signature or thumb impression.
When he receives the money order acknowledgment duly signed by the payee,
he should attach it to the usual form of receipt (Form T.R. 67) in which he
should show clearly the full amount of the refund and the deduction made
from it on account of the money order commission and then dispose of it as a
paid voucher in the usual way.

(iv) The  Treasury  Officer  should  issue  postal  money  orders  with
reference to these directions only in the first half of the month, so that he may
be able to send complete vouchers for the payments with the monthly treasury
account.

      RULES  219-221

219. Repayment of civil courts deposits.—Before the Treasury Officer
pays an order of a civil court for the repayment of deposit, he should require
the person who presents the order to acknowledge receipt on the reverse of
the order. If that person is not the person named in the court’s order, he should
be required to satisfy the Treasury Officer that the signature purporting to be
that  of  the  person  named  in  the  court’s  order  is  authentic  and  that  he  is
authorised to receive payment.

220. Receipt stamps.—The Treasury Officer should take special care
to see that all receipt stamps on vouchers are so defaced that they cannot be
used again, so that no one may be tempted to steal vouchers for the sake of
the stamps on them.

221. Transfer payments.—

(a) When a bill, or other document is paid wholly by “transfer”, that
is, by entry of the amount in the accounts as a receipt under some head of
account, no cash is paid out and the Treasurer should neither enter the item in
his cash book nor stamp “Paid” on the bill, or other document. When the
entries in the accounts in respect of a payment by transfer are complete, the
Section Head in the Accounts Department should stamp “Paid by transfer”
on the bill, or other document.

Exception.—*(1) Deleted.

* This amendment shall be deemed to have come into force on the 1st

day of October, 1985.

manufacturing, production or supply of articles or repair
operations the following procedure shall be followed.

No adjustment is required if the cost of supplies/services is  ` 250 or less
in  each  case  except  in  respect  of  issues  of  stores  of  stock  or  material  on
account of the work within a Public Works Division or between two such
divisions or between one Public Works Division and another service department
which shall be settled by adjustment irrespective of the amount involved.

RULES  221-222

(b) When a payment is to be made by transfer to a revenue or receipt
head for which a subsidiary register is maintained (e.g., Land Revenue) the Treasury
Officer’s payment order should indicate the major and detailed heads affected as
in the following example:—

*Pay  `…….....by transfer to credit of 029. Land Revenue (a) Land Tax”.

(c) When a bill is presented for an amount to be paid in the form of
service  postage  stamps  required  by  the  drawing  officer,  the Treasury  Officer
should pass it for “payment by transfer”, issue the stamps, enter the amount in
the list of payments and credit the amount of the bill to the appropriate head. He
should refuse payment if the certificate as to the disposal of the previous supply
of such stamps, referred to in Rule 192 (a) above, is not furnished with the bill.

(d) When the amount of a bill or other document is payable partly in
cash and partly by transfer credit to some head of account, an entry should be
made  in  the  number  book  for  the  transfer  credit  and  the  Treasury  Officer
should show separately in his payment order the amounts payable in cash
and by transfer respectively. The Treasurer should stamp “paid” on the bill or

RULE  223

issue  a  new  Bill  Book  to  the  drawing  officer  concerned
recording the fact that it is issued in lieu of the lost Bill
Book on the first page of the book. The treasury officer
shall simultaneously intimate the fact of issue of the new
Bill Book in place of the lost one, to the controlling officer
of the concerned drawing officer.

(d) The drawing officer shall also reconstruct the lost Bill Book,
with reference to the entries in the cash book, contingent
registers,  etc.,  of  his  office  and  verify  the  entries  in  the

registers in the Treasury/Sub Treasury. The reconstructed
Bill Book with the certificate reconstruction and verification
with  the  Treasury/Sub  Treasury  figures  recorded  by  the
drawing office shall be made available to the inspecting
officers for scrutiny.

(e) In  case,  a  lost  Bill  Book  is  found  out  subsequently  the

proper  attestation.  He  shall  also  take  steps  to  keep  the
same  under  safe  custody,  along  with  other  used-up  Bill
Books. The fact of recovery of lost Bill Book shall also be

RULES    223-227

NOTE 11.—A stock-cum-issue register of blank Bill Books shall be maintained
at the Treasuries in Form 74 B and the stock shall be subjected
to verification by the Inspecting Officers and audit parties. The
serial number of the books received and issued shall be noted
in  the  register  together  with  the  invoice/letter  number  of
Government Press for receipt and requisition letter number and
date of issue. The blank Treasury Bill Book shall be kept under
double lock under the joint responsibility of the Treasury Officer
and the Treasurer. Bill Book shall be issued according to serial
number (first in first out method.)

224. Memorandum  of  deductions  from  bills.—When  the  Treasury
Officer pays a bill drawn by a Survey Officer or other Drawing Officer whose
headquarters is at a distance from the treasury, he should give the messenger,
who brought the bill, a memorandum in (Form T.R. 75) showing clearly the
amount  of  cash  and  Government  drafts  (if  any)  handed  over,  to  him  and
explaining  the  deductions,  or  alterations  if  any,  made  in  the  bill  or  bills
presented.  The  memorandum  should  be  bi-lingual  (i.e.,  in  English  and
Malayalam), since it is important that the messenger should satisfy himself
that the amount of cash and drafts (if any) shown in it as handed over to him
is correct; when the messenger is not able to read, the Treasury Officer should
himself explain to him the entries in the memorandum.

225. The Treasury Officer should maintain in Form T.R. 76 a Register of

Bills received for pre-audit before payment at a sub treasury.

226. When making any payment amounting to ` 250 or more to a non-

commission, bonus, remuneration or reward of any kind, the Treasury Officer
should furnish details of the payment and the payee’s address to the Income
Tax Officer concerned, or, if he has any doubt as to which Income Tax Officer
is concerned to the Commissioner of Income Tax.

The minimum limit of ` 250 applies to each single payment made to any

one person and not to the total payments made to him during the year.

B.  Sub Treasuries

227. The  procedure  prescribed  in  rules  210  to  229  in  regard  to  the
payment of moneys at district treasuries at stations where the treasury does
not transact its cash business through the Bank, shall apply generally mutatis
mutandis also to sub treasuries at such stations and at the headquarters of

districts, except that, unless there is a specific order of the Government to the
contrary in regard to any class of payments, no payment shall be made at any
sub treasury except upon a cash order drawn by the Treasury Officer on the
sub treasury or a bill passed by him for payment at the sub treasury. Alterations
and corrections in pass orders on bills payable at sub treasuries should be
attested by the full signature of the Treasury Officer concerned. Bills passed
for  payment  at  sub  treasuries  should  be  sent  by  the  Treasury  Officers
concerned  direct  to  the  sub  treasuries  where  they  are  payable,  intimation
being sent at the same time to the departmental officers concerned asking
them to take payment at the sub treasury on production of the intimation duly
endorsed by them in favour of the person to whom, or to whose authorise
messenger, payment is desired. The intimation should be triplicate in Form
T.R. 77.

*A register in Form T.R. 18 shall be maintained at the Sub Treasuries for
noting  details  of  passed  bills  for  payment  before  the  bills  are  sent  to  the
Treasurer  for  effecting  payments. This  register  is  to  be  maintained  by  the
Sub Treasury Officers, duly initialling each entry simultaneously with the
signing of the Pay Order, and before they are entrusted to the Treasurers for
making payment. At the end of the day, if any bill is returned by the Treasurer
without actual payment, the corresponding entry in Form T.R. 18 along with
the related entries in the subsidiary and other registers should be cancelled
under his initials.

228.

(a) A sub treasury shall pay valid claims of the classes specified
in Appendix 13 without the Treasury Officer’s express pay order. A district
treasury  shall  not,  except  under  special  arrangements  or  on  particular
occasions, pay claims which fall into any of those classes.

(b) When the office of the Accountant General issues an order to
make a payment at a sub treasury, it shall ordinarily send the order to the Sub
Treasury Officer through the Treasury Officer. If, on account of urgency, it is
sent direct, the Accountant General shall inform the Treasury Officer to the
fact and furnish the Sub Treasury Officer direct, if it has not already been
done,  with  a  specimen  signature  of  the Audit  Officer  who  has  signed  the
order.

(c)

Items  placed  in  deposit  by  the  Sub  Treasury  Officer  himself
without  the  authority  of  the  Treasury  Officer  may  be  repaid  on  his  own
authority but amounts credited in other Sub Treasuries can be paid only on

(a) Payment of land cess and fishery rentals to panchayats.—
For  paying  fishery  rentals  or  half-yearly  or  final  instalments  of  land  cess
due to panchayats the Treasury Officer or Sub Treasury Officer should prepare
a  consolidated  bill  in  triplicate,  including  the  amounts  payable  by  book
adjustment as well as by cash, with full details as to the amount due to each
panchayat which should be obtained from the Collector and draw the total
amount only on the date fixed and notified to the President of panchayats to

If a panchayat has a banking account with the Sub Treasury, the panchayat
should be effected by book adjustment. The Treasury Officer or the Sub Treasury
Officer concerned should certify that such amounts have been credited to the
accounts of the respective panchayats. When the Presidents appear in person
the officer-in-charge of the treasury should disburse the amounts due to them and
obtain their acknowledgments in the special register prescribed for the purpose.

disbursing  the  amounts  in  the  above  manner,  furnish  a  certificate  of
disbursement  to  the  Treasury  Officer  retaining  the  special  register.  The
Treasury Officer will arrange to receive individual certificates from each sub
treasury, and on the strength of the same and on the strength of the records of
disbursement made at the District Treasury furnish to the Accountant General
along with the treasury account, a consolidated certificate of disbursement
for purposes of audit. A certificate of payment should also be endorsed on the
triplicate  bill  sent  to  the  District  Panchayat  Officer  concerned  who  is
responsible for auditing the accounts of the class II panchayats.

(b) Payment of surcharge on stamp duty.—The procedure laid down
in sub rule (a) above namely, preparation by the treasury of bills in triplicate
and  sending  the  triplicate  copy  to  the  District  Panchayat  Officer  shall  be
followed for payment of surcharge on stamp duty.

CHAPTER II

TREASURIES  WHICH  TRANSACT  THEIR  CASH  BUSINESS
THROUGH  THE  BANKS

230. At places where the treasury transacts its cash business through
the Bank, all payments shall be made at the Bank unless the Government have
specially ordered, in regard to any class of payments, that they shall be made
elsewhere. At district headquarters stations where the district treasury transacts
its  cash  business  through  the  Bank  the  sub  treasury  payments  shall
nevertheless be made at the sub treasury.

NOTE   1.—In treasuries where cash business is transacted through the Bank,
all  pension  claims  will  be  paid  at  the  treasuries  themselves
irrespective of any monetary limit. The amounts required for the
payment of the pensions will be drawn from the Bank as an imprest.

Exception—As an exception to Note I above, pensions which are collected
through  the  State  Bank  of  India  or  the  State  Bank  of
Travancore, through their branches conducting Government
business,  will  be  paid  at  the  Bank  counters  instead  of  a
treasury  counters.

NOTE   2.—All cash transactions relating to Treasury Savings Bank will be
done at the treasury. *The procedure prescribed in Note 2 to sub
rule (1) of rule 210, will be followed in Bank Treasuries as well.

231.

(a) Except for bank drafts and cheques which shall be presented
at the Bank for payment direct, all bills and other documents shall first be
presented at the treasury. The Officer-in-charge of the treasury shall examine
the bill or other document and if he approves and passes the charge, he shall
enface on it an order to pay a specified amount. The order shall be numbered,
dated and signed and the particulars of it shall be entered in the register of
payment orders issued. The treasury shall then send the bill or other documents
together with a list in duplicate of such bills or other documents to the Bank in
a box through a special messenger who should be an employee of the treasury.
The box should be properly locked and sealed in the presence of the Officer-
in-charge of the treasury who should keep one of the two keys of the lock in
his personal custody. The duplicate key should be in the personal custody of
the agent of the Bank. On receipt of the box the agent will after verifying the
seal to ascertain that there has been no tampering on the way, open the box
with  his  key,  verify  the  contents  with  entries  in  the  list  of  bills  or  other
documents and return one copy of the list with his acknowledgment of the
bills and other documents and the box to the treasury through the messenger.
Payment will be made by the Bank when the payee presents the token received
by him from the treasury at the Bank. In passing bills and other documents for
payment  at  the  Bank,  the  Treasury  or  Sub  Treasury  Officer  shall  observe
generally, rules 210 to 229 above.

**NOTE  1.—Bills sent through messengers to the Treasury and the Bank
should be endorsed by the drawing officer in the name of the
messenger. The messenger’s signature should be taken on the
bill itself,—

(i) in the drawing office, when it is endorsed in the messengers

name, duly identified and attested by the drawing officer;

(ii) at the Bank, when the bill amount is actually paid to him;

(iii) the messenger should acknowledge receipt of the bill amount

and discharge the claim before token is obtained from the Treasury.

RULE  231

**NOTE 2—Requisition by the Accountant General or an Officer of the Indian
Audit and Accounts Department authorised by the Accountant
General in this behalf for obtaining Reserve Bank of India drafts
for effecting monetary settlement of inter Governmental and
other miscellaneous transactions need not be presented at the
treasury, but may be presented at the bank direct without the
express pay order from the Treasury.

(b) The above procedure should be followed mutatis mutandis in
cases where bills are sent to the Treasury or the Bank by Government servants
other than drawing officers. When the amount of a bill is to be paid partly at
the Bank at the district headquarters and partly at sub treasuries, the Treasury
Officer shall authorise payment of the bill partly in cash for the amount required
for disbursement at headquarters and partly in drafts or cash orders for which
formal applications should be attached to the bills.

(c) The Bank shall make payment strictly in accordance with the pay
order of the officer-in-charge of the treasury, after obtaining on the bill or
other documents a proper discharge from the payee in addition to the signature
at  the  foot  of  the  bill. All  bills,  cheques  and  other  documents,  passed  by
Treasury Officers and the Accountant General for payment at the Bank, as
well as Interest Payment Orders, etc., being non-negotiable instruments warrant
special precaution on the part of the Bank in the matter of identification of the
payee. All such claims have normally to be presented by the payee personally,
but where payment is desired to be made to an endorsee (other than a banker)
or a messenger, the provisions of rule 188 (viii) or the rule in the Note under (a)
above, as the case may be, should be strictly followed by the drawing officer.
The Bank will not, however, disburse payments of such claims unless the
Bank  is  satisfied  about  the  identity  of  the  person  receiving  payments  as
attested by the drawing officer in accordance with rule 188 (viii) or Note under
(a) above, as the case may be. The Bank shall also verify before making the
payment  that  the  signature  of  the  drawing  officer  attesting  the  payee’s
signature tallies with that on the bill as passed by the Treasury Officer.

Payment of cheque including Public Debt Office interest warrants
which  are  governed  by  the  Negotiable  Instruments Act  shall  be  made  in
accordance  with  the  provisions  of  that Act  and  any  generally  recognised
practice established among bankers by custom.

RULES  231-232

A  bill  *pre-checked  by  the Accountant  General  and  enfaced  for
payment at a Treasury or an authorisation issued by the Accountant General
for non-recurring payments due to a gazetted government servant such as
fees, honoraria, etc., should not be paid if it is presented at the Treasury three
months after the date of enfacement or authorisation as the case may be. Such
bills  or  authorisations  for  payments  debitable  to  travelling  allowance,
contingencies, grant-in-aid, scholarships, stipend, etc., passed for payment
and issued in one financial year shall not be paid after the close of that year
even  if  three  months  have  not  elapsed  since  the  date  of  enfacement/
authorisation. In all such cases where the period of validity is over, the bills/
authorisations should be returned to the Accountant General by the Treasury
Officer with a non-payment certificate for cancellation of the enfacement/
authorisation,  if  fresh  sanction  or  allotment  of  funds  is  necessary  or  for
revalidation of the *pre-checked enfacement/authorisation as the case may
be, by the Accountant General.

*This amendment shall be deemed to have come into force on the

17th day of April, 1986.

(d) Payment orders issued by the Treasury shall be valid only for a
period not exceeding ten days to be fixed by the Collector. If the payee does
not turn up to receive payment at the Bank before the expiry of the fixed time,
the Bank shall return the bill to the Treasury Officer for revalidation on further
application of the party.

NOTE—T.A. Contingent, Grants-in-aid, Scholarship and Stipend bills which
have  been  passed  for  payment  by  the  Treasury  Officer  during  a
financial year will not be paid at the Bank in the next financial year.
In such cases the passed bills which remain unpaid at the close of
the 1st working day of the financial year should be returned by the
Bank to the Treasury Officers concerned who shall cancel the ‘Pay
Order’ and sent back the bills to the parties concerned. This restriction
will also apply to other types of bills which are payable from the
allotment of a specified year only.

232. When  the  drawing  officer  desires  payment  of  a  bill  or  other
document  to  be  made  wholly  or  partly  in  drafts,  he  shall  submit  a  formal
application with the bill and indicate the manner in which he desires payment
to be made in his receipt on the bill. If the Officer-in-charge of the treasury is
satisfied that the issue of drafts is permissible he shall specify accordingly in
the pay order the manner in which payment shall be made.

Treasury Officer concerned, who shall examine it make the necessary record
in the manner prescribed in the Government Securities Manual and, if interest
is payable to the holder under the rules, give him an order on the Bank for
payment of the amount due.

234. The treasury shall prepare all advices or certificates of payment
which have to be sent to any public officer or department under any rule since
the point to be advised or certified is not that the moneys have been, paid out
by  the  bank  but  that  the  payment  has  been  duly  entered  in  the  treasury
accounts.

235. Treasury  Bill  Book.—The  Treasury  Bill  Book  need  not  be
presented at the bank along with any bill passed for payment at the Bank. The
Treasury should fill up columns 7 to 11 of the book even when the payment is

237. Special to Judicial Department.—Repayment of Civil Court’s and

Criminal Court’s deposits.-

(1) High Court.—The repayment of deposits in the High Court is
governed by the original and appellate side rules of the High Court contained
in the “Civil Rules of Practice”.

 (2)  Other Civil Courts.—When any person presents an order of a
civil court for repayment of a deposit in whole or in part, the Bank should
require  him  to  acknowledge  receipt  of  the  amount  on  the  reverse  of  the
order. If he is not the person named in the court’s payment order, the Bank
should require him to satisfy it that the person named in the court’s order has
signed  an  acknowledgment  of  receipt  on  the  reverse  of  the  order  and  has
authorized him to receive the payment.

Every order of a civil court for repayment of a deposit should be taken
to the Treasury Officer for countersignature before it is presented at the Bank,

RULES  237-238

unless  the  Bank  keeps  a  personal  ledger  account  for  the  deposits  of  each
court. Each civil court for which the Bank maintains such an account should
intimate the Bank, from time to time the amount of the lapsed deposits which
should  be  deducted  from  the  balance  shown  in  the  account  and  the  pass
book.

The Bank should not make payment on any order for the repayment
of a civil court deposit which is presented after the end of the account month
in which it was issued (c.f. Rule 206 above).

NOTE—The personal ledger accounts for the deposits of civil courts dealing
with treasuries which transact their cash business through the Bank
are maintained by the Bank.

(3) Repayment  of  Revenue  and  Criminal  Courts’  deposits.—A
deposit  standing  at  a  person’s  credit  in  a  Treasury  Officer’s  Judge’s  or
Magistrate’s accounts should be repaid only on the order of the government
servants  who  maintain  the  registers  in  which  it  is  entered. A  person  who
claims the repayment of any such deposit should apply to the government
servant who received it. If the claim is in order, the government servant should,
after examining the check register and making the necessary entry regarding
the  repayment,  give  the  applicant  an  order  for  payment  at  the  Bank. A
repayment  order  signed  by  a  Judge  or  Magistrate  should  be  taken  to  the
Treasury Officer for countersignature before it is presented at the Bank, unless
the Bank keeps a personal ledger account for the deposits of each court. Each
Magistrate’s  Court  for  which  the  Bank  maintains  such  an  account  should
intimate to the Bank, from time to time, the account of the lapsed deposits
which should be deducted from the balance shown in the account and the
pass  book.

The bank should not make payment on any order for the repayment of
a revenue deposit or a criminal court deposit, unless it is presented before the
expiry of three months from the date of issue or before the close of the financial
year in which it is issued, whichever is earlier (c.f. Rule 207 above).

238. Special to Local Funds.—In cases where the banking accounts
of the local funds are kept at the bank (See Instruction III in Chapter V  in Part
VIII below) all adjustments made to the debit/credit of such account, either by
the  treasury  or  by  the  Accountant  General,  should  without  delay,  be
communicated by the treasury to the bank.

RULES  239-241

SECTION   III

Cheques

CHAPTER  I

GENERAL

A.  Applicable  to  Departments  generally

(a)

239.

Save  as  expressly  provided  in  these  rules,  no  person  is
authorized to draw on a treasury by means of cheques without the special
order of the Government and before he has been placed in account with the
Treasury by the Accountant General.

(b) Cheques shall ordinarily be drawn on the district treasury but
certain government servants of certain departments are authorized to draw
cheques on sub treasuries also. [See Rule 260 (b) * in regard to Public Works
Officers]. When the Collector considers it desirable, he may give permission
to a drawing officer to draw cheques on the sub treasuries in his district.

Cheques  from  a  cheque  book  obtained  from  a  particular  district
treasury (See Rule 252) shall not be drawn on any treasury outside that district.
A drawing officer shall use a different cheque book for the district treasury
and for each sub treasury on which he draws and enter a distinguished letter
and a separate series of numbers on the cheques from each book.

240. Whenever a cheque is presented, the treasury shall carefully examine
the number printed on it in order to ascertain that it was really taken from the book
notified as in use by the drawing officer whose signature it purports to bear. If the
payee is not known at the treasury the Treasury Officer shall carefully consider
the date, serial number and amount of the cheque as well as the handwriting and
make any enquiries that he considers necessary; if he then feels any doubt as to
the genuineness of the cheque or the identity of the payee, he shall defer payment
and refer to the drawing officer.

A  cheque  drawn  on  a  treasury  may  be  crossed  in  accordance  with  the
provisions of Chapter XIV of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (Indian Act
XXVI of 1881), and such crossing is no bar to its being paid at the treasury on
which it is drawn.

241. Whenever  a  government  servant  draws  cheque  (other  than  a
cheque the amount of which is typed in words with perforated letters by a

PART  V

RULES  241-242

special cheque-writing machine), he shall see that it has written across it at
right angle to the type the word “under” followed by an amount a little larger
than that for which he draws the cheque. For example,  “under rupees thirty
only” means that the cheque is for an amount less than ` 30 but not less than
` 20, whilst “under rupees eight hundred only” means that it is for an amount
less  than  `  800  but  not  less  than  `  700.  No  abbreviation  such  as  “eleven
hundred”  for  “one  thousand  one  hundred”  may  be  used.  The  amount  of  a
cheque shall be written in the manner prescribed for bills in Rule 163 (c) above.

A common form of fraud in regard to cheques consists in altering the
word “one” into “four” by prefixing an ‘ f ‘ and changing the ‘e’ into ‘r’ as the
figure can easily be altered correspondingly to 4. The word “twenty” when
written  carelessly.,  has  also  sometimes  been  changed  into  “seventy”. A
government servant who draws a cheque in which the word ‘one’ or ‘twenty’
occurs shall therefore write the word very carefully in order to make such a
fraud impossible. The Treasury Officer shall examine the words “four” and
“seventy” and the corresponding figures in cheques with special care.

All cheques shall be written and signed in indelibile (unwashable) ink

only, which can be obtained from the Controller of Stationery, Trivandrum.

Exception—*The protective endorsement “under” followed by amount
a little larger than that for which the cheque is drawn need
not be insisted in respect of Treasury Savings Bank cheque
and fixed deposit certificates presented at the treasuries for
encashment.

(a)

242.

Cheques  drawn  in  favour  of  Government  Officers  or
departments for payment on account of interdepartmental or intergovernmental
dues shall always be crossed “Account Payee” if drawn on the Bank and in
other cases superscribed with the words “Account Government-not payable
in cash” without any crossing.

      (b)        Cheques, the amounts of which are payable to officers of
the Government to enable them to make disbursement of pay and allowances
of non-gazetted staff, contingent expenditure etc., on behalf of Government
shall be issued in favour of the government official concerned by designation,
the word “only” being added after the designation of the payee officer on the
cheque. Such cheques shall not be crossed but shall bear the superscription
‘Not transferable’.

PART  V

RULES  242-244

(c)

(i) Subject to the provisions of the sub-clause (b) all cheques
in payment of personal claims of government servants and pensioners shall
invariably be to the “order” of the payee.

 (ii)  Cheques coming within the purview of sub-clause (a), if drawn
on the bank, shall be crossed generally with the words “………………….. and
Co.”  but  without  the  superscription  “Account  payee  only”    wherever  the
amount exceeds ` 1,000. Such cheques for amounts not exceeding  ` 1,000
also shal normally be crossed, unless the payee specifically asks for an “Open”
cheque in which case it need not be crossed.

(d) In all other cases, cheques if drawn on the bank, shall invariably
be crossed with the superscription “Account Payee only” added between the
lines on crossing. Where the payee is believed to have a banking account,
further precaution shall be adopted, wherever possible, by crossing the cheque
specially (instead of by the general crossing)  “…………………………. and
Co.” by quoting the name of the bank through which the payee will receive
payment  and  by  adding  the  words  “Account  Payee  only-not  negotiable”.
Such cheques for amount not exceeding ` 1,000 may, however, be issued as
“open” cheques if so desired by the payee, but only as “order “ cheques.

NOTE—Cheques drawn on a Treasury should not be crossed and in cases in
which any such cheque has been crossed inadvertently such crossing
will have no significance in making payment.

     The Treasury Officer may decline to make any payment on a cheque
endorsed  as  payable  to  “order”  or  to  any  person  if  he  is  unable  to  satisfy
himself as to the identity of the person claiming payment.

243.

[Deleted]

244. As a general rule, the Treasury Officer shall not pay a cheque payable
to order, unless it is receipted by the payee himself or another person in whose
favour it has been regularly endorsed for payment. If, in special circumstances,
the head of an office is unable himself to receive cheques payable to his order
owing to absence on our or some other sufficient cause and considers that strict
compliance with the ordinary rule would cause undue inconvenience, he may by
a  written  order  specially  authorize  a  gazetted  government  servant  to  endorse
“for” him cheques drawn in his favour by his official designation. The head of the
office shall send a copy of any such order at once to the Treasury Officer, and the
Treasury  Officer  shall  then  treat  an  endorsement  by  the  duly  authorized
government servant as though it were an endorsement by the head of the office.

than `10, except when it is done in order to comply with the provisions of a
law or a rule having the force of law.

Exception—(1)

Government servants who are permitted to draw cheque
for  the  pay  and  allowances  of  their  staff  (such  as
officers of Public Works Department who draw cheques
for  payment  to  work  establishment  staff)  may  draw
cheques  for  a  sum  less  than  `10  for  remitting  the
insurance  premia  or  the  contribution  to  a  Provident
Fund.

Exception—(2)

Cheques  for  sums  less  than  `10  may  be  drawn  in
respect of withdrawals from Personal Deposit Accounts.

Exception—(3)

*Cheques  for  sums  less  than  `10  may  be  drawn  in
respect  of  withdrawals  from  Treasury  Savings  Bank
Accounts.

(b) A cheque shall remain current only for three months from the

date of issue.

246. When a government servant issues a cheque in payment of any
amount due by the Government and the cheque is honoured on presentation,
payment  shall  be  deemed  to  be  made  on  the  date  on  which  the  cheque  is
handed over to the payee or his authorized messenger or on which the cover
containing it is put into the post. If, however, the cheque is marked as “not
payable before a certain date” which is later than the date mentioned in the
previous sentence, payment shall be deemed to be made on the date on which
the  cheque  becomes  payable.  Such  a  cheque  shall  not  be  charged  in  the
accounts until the date on which it becomes payable.

247. When a government servant pays an endorsed bill by cheque, he
shall not disregard the endorsement and issue the cheque in favour of drawer
of the bill.

248. Local fund Cheque.—The Treasury or Sub Treasury Officer shall
not permit the withdrawal of any moneys relating to a local fund from the
treasury otherwise than on cheques taken from a cheque book issued by the
treasury  and  signed  by  the  duly  authorized  officer  of  each  fund,  e.g.,  the

president of a local board and the executive authority of a  municipal council.
No local fund cheque shall be paid, unless the balance at the credit of the fund
is sufficient to cover the payment.

NOTE 1—The account of a local fund at the treasury is Purely a banking
account,  and  the  nature  of  the  disbursement  need  not  be
specified on any local fund cheque.

NOTE 2—When the executive authority or other officer of a municipal council
who  is  authorized  to  draw  cheques  against  the  funds  of  the
municipal  council  lodged  with  the  Government,  makes  over
charge of his office either temporarily or permanently, he should
send a specimen of the relieving officer’s signature together
with a certificate in Form T.R. 78 to the Treasury Officer.

NOTE 3—When  the  president  or  other  officer  of  a  local  body  who  is
authorized to draw cheques against the funds of the local body
lodged with the Government makes over charge of his office
either temporarily or permanently he should send a specimen of
the relieving officer’s signature together with a certificate in
Form T.R. 78 to the Treasury Officer:

Provided that when the functions of the president devolve on
the vice-president under the provisions of any enactment under
which the local body is constituted, it shall not be necessary
for the president to send the specimen of the relieving officer’s
signature and the certificate mentioned in his rule if they have
been sent to the Treasury Officer on a previous occasion, but
the president shall, in every such case report the fact of such
devolution  of  powers  on  the  vice-president,  mentioning  the
latter by name.

249. Time expired cheques.—If a cheque, the currency of which has
expired owing to its not being presented at the treasury for payment within
three months from the date of issue, is returned to the drawing officer, he shall
destroy it and may then draw a new cheque in place of it, if necessary. He shall
record on the counterfoil of the old cheque the fact that the cheque has been
destroyed and the number and date of the new cheque and shall enter on the
counterfoil of the new cheque the number and date of the old one.

Officer shall at once examine the lists of paid cheque and, if he finds that the
cheque has not been paid take steps to stop payment. A board showing the
particulars  of  all  “stopped”  cheques  shall  be  hungs  up  before  the  clerk
concerned.  The  Treasury  Officer  shall  also  send  the  drawing  officer  a

On  receipt  of  the  certificate  duly  signed  by  the  Treasury  Officer  the
drawing officer shall cancel the original cheque and make the necessary entries
in his accounts and may then issue another in its place.

If  any  “stopped”  cheque  is  presented  at  the  treasury  for  payment  the
clerk  concerned  shall  at  once  bring  the  fact  to  the  notice  of  the  Treasury
Officer and the latter shall refuse payment and return the cheque to the person
who presented it with the words “payment stopped” written across it.

NOTE— *If the currency of a cheque expires on Saturday, the Treasury Officer
shall also verify the list of cheques paid for the subsequent working
day of the Bank before the issue of non-payment certificate, wherever
necessary.

251. Cancelled cheques.—The drawing officer shall cancel any cheque
which has remained unpaid for twelve months from the date of issue. When a
cheque is cancelled for any reason, the fact shall be recorded on its counterfoil
and the cheque, if in the drawing officer’s possession, shall be destroyed. If
the cheque is not in his possession and payment has not already been stopped
under the preceding rule, he shall at once request the Treasury Officer to stop
payment of the cheque. If the Treasury Officer then finds that the cheque has
not been paid, he shall stop payment and send the drawing officer a certificate
in the manner prescribed in the preceding rule.

RULE  252

(a)

252.

Cheque books required by the officers of Government and
administrators of the personal deposit accounts, local fund accounts or any
other fund are printed by the Superintendent, Government Presses. All supplies
of cheque book forms should be made by Treasury Officers who will receive
their supply from the Government Press. The Treasury Officers should examine
the cheque book forms carefully on receipt and count the number of forms in
each book. They should keep the cheque books in their stock and issue them
one by one as books are used up. Every Treasury Officer should ascertain the
requirements  in  his  district  and  send  a  consolidated  indent  to  the
Superintendent, Government Presses, Trivandrum.

NOTE 1—The Treasury Officers should examine carefully, on receipt the
unused cheque books or blank cheque forms returned to them
by drawing officers, count the number of forms in each book,
check them with reference to the advice of return sent by the
drawing  officers  (See  note  under  Rule  253)  and  keep  them
safely in stock.

NOTE 2—The  stock  of  cheque  books  which  have  become  obsolete  and
used  and  unused  cheque  books  returned  to  the  Treasury  by
the drawing officers shall be destroyed under the orders of the
Director of Treasuries. The period prescribed in Article 358,
Kerala Financial Code shall also be satisfied in the matter of
destruction  of  counterfoils  of  used  cheque  books.  The
destruction shall be done by incineration in the presence of the
Deputy Director duly authorised by the Director of Treasuries.
The fact of destruction shall also be recorded in the concerned
stock register under the attestation of the Treasury Officer and
the  Deputy  Director  in  whose  presence  the  destruction  is
conducted.

(b) A drawing officer who requires a fresh cheque book should sign
and send to the Treasury Officer the printed requisition form inserted towards
the end of each cheque books. The Treasury Officer should then supply a
cheque book if the request is in order, but he should never supply more than
one cheque book on a single requisition form. He should examine every cheque
book again at the time of issue and should be careful to see that it is duly and
promptly acknowledged. *He should issue the cheque book only after signing
an endorsement on the following lines on the requisition slip presented by the
drawing officer, namely:—

253. A drawing officer should invariably keep the cheque book supplied
to him in his personal custody under lock and key. Whenever a drawing officer
hands over charge of his office, a note should be recorded over the signature of
both the relieved and the relieving government servants showing the number of
cheque books and unused cheques handed over. The note should be made in the
cash book or other permanent register in which the expenditure for which cheques
are drawn is recorded.

If a cheque book or a blank cheque form is lost, the drawing officer should,
at once, inform the Treasury Officer, furnishing the numbers of the lost cheque
forms. The Treasury Officer should then stop payment of all cheques drawn on
forms bearing any of those numbers.

NOTE—If a drawing officer has to return to the Treasury Officer unused cheque
books or blank cheque forms, he should examine them carefully, before
sending them by registered post to the Treasury Officer by name and
should take care to see that they are duly and promptly acknowledged.
A separate advice of despatch of the cheque books or forms giving full
details of numbers of the cheque books and cheque forms should also
be sent to the Treasury Officer simultaneously.

254. Whenever a Government servant sends a cheque to the treasury for
payment, not in cash, but by transfer credit in the treasury accounts, he should
endorse on it the words “Received payment by transfer credit to ………………..”
and sign below them. Failure to do this would facilitate criminal misappropriation
of the amount. The treasury should enter in the number book every cheque that is
to be paid by transfer in whole or in part.

NOTE— *When cheques are presented by Departmental Officers for adjustment
in Treasury accounts or for collection, they shall present the cheques
with a covering list in duplicate and the Treasury Officer, in turn, shall
return one copy to the Departmental Officer as acknowledgment.

      RULES  255-257

255. When a pass book or list of cheques cashed (Form T.R. 79) is
maintained  for  any  banking  or  drawing  account  at  the  treasury,  it  should
remain in the custody of the drawing officer, except when it is sent periodically
to the Treasury Officer to be written up. Ordinarily the drawing officer should
send it to be written up at least once a month. On receipt of the pass book, the
Treasury Officer should have the amount of each paid cheque recorded in it
with reference to the registers maintained in the treasury and (in regard to
cheques paid at the Bank or at a sub-treasury) the daily sheets. The cheque
book number and distinguishing letter, if any, as well as the individual cheque
number  should  be  shown  for  each  cheque  entered  in  the  pass  book.  The
Treasury Officer should ordinarily return the pass book to the drawing officer
the same day.

256. When a cheque is drawn on a treasury or sub treasury for a refund
of revenue and the amount is to be remitted by money order, the payment to
the Post Office should be made by a separate cheque drawn on the treasury or
sub treasury in favour of the Postmaster.

257. A  Land  Acquisition  Officer  may,  under  the  orders  of  the
Government make all or any of his payments by issuing cheques on the treasury,
provided that the property is not so far from the treasury that this method of
payment  would  cause  undue  inconvenience  to  the  payees.  The  rules
prescribing the procedure for the payment of compensation for land acquired
under the Land Acquisition Act should be strictly adhered to in respect of
such  payments.

257 A. Letters of credit.—(1) When under the provision of this rule or
under any special order of Government a letter of credit is issued in favour of
a drawing officer, such letter of credit shall specify the maximum amount upto
which the officer credited shall have authority to draw on the particular Treasury
on which the letter of credit has been issued.

(2)  A drawing officer in whose favour a letter of credit has been issued is
not permitted to draw the whole amount and place it in a separate drawing
account at the Treasury or the Bank or in a private account.

subordinate to it.

(d) A Divisional Officer may authorize any Sub Divisional Officer
working under him to draw cheques against his own account with a District
Treasury (including Sub treasuries under it). No separate accounts shall be

RULES  263-266

263. Before a drawing officer of # any of the departments mentioned in

sub-rule (d) of rule 162 brings a cheque book into use, he should mark all the

CHAPTER II

SPECIAL  RULES  FOR  DRAWAL  OF  CHEQUES  WHEN  THE  TREASURY

TRANSACTS  ITS  CASH  BUSINESS

THROUGH  THE  BANK

Rules  applicable  to  Departments  generally

267. Cheques.—The rules contained in rules 239 to 251 shall apply
mutatis  mutandis  to  cheques  drawn  by  government  servants  on  the  Bank
where the treasury transacts its cash business through it except that every
correction or alteration in a cheque drawn on the Bank shall be attested by the
full signature of the government servant who signs it. When such cheques
are presented at the Bank direct in accordance with the rules without the pay
order of the officer-in-charge of the treasury the Bank shall see that the relevant
rules are duly observed. When a cheque drawn by a government servant on
the Bank is, in accordance with the rules, first presented at the treasury before
it is presented for payment at the Bank, the Treasury Officer shall examine it
and enface on it an order to the Bank to pay the amount, if any, which he finds
to be properly payable.

 Explanation.—*Cheques drawn by Government Servants in #the departments
mentioned in sub-rule (d) of rule 162 in respect of item
kept outside the purview of the letters of credit referred
to in sub-rule(j) of rule 258, may be presented at the bank
direct for payment and no pay order of the Treasury or
Sub Treasury Officer is necessary. Similarly cheques drawn
on the personal deposit accounts and the banking accounts
of local funds which, are maintained by the Bank, may be
presented at the Bank direct for payment without the pay
order of the Treasury or Sub Treasury Officer. Rules 208
and 248 should be observed mutatis mutandis in regard
to withdrawals from these accounts. All other cheques drawn
by  government  servants  shall  first  be  presented  at  the
treasury and Bank shall make payment only on the pay
order  of  the  officer-in-charge  of  the  treasury.

RULES  267-269

NOTE 1.— Cheques.—Rules 248 to 266 above apply mutatis mutandis to
cheques drawn by government servants on the Bank where the
treasury  business  is  transacted  through  it.  The  specimen
signature and certificates mentioned in notes 2 and 3 under rule
248 should be sent to the Bank, when the cheques are drawn on
the Bank.

NOTE 2.— Lost cheques.—The provisions of rules 250 and 253 should be
observed  mutatis  mutandis  in  regard  to  cheques  drawn  by
departmental officer on the Bank direct. When such a cheque
is lost, the loss of the cheque will be reported by the drawing
officer  to  the  officer  of  the  Bank  who  will  issue  an
acknowledgment to him. This acknowledgment would imply that
the Bank will take the necessary precautions against payment
of the cheque if presented thereafter. The drawing officer will
then advise the Treasury Officer that the acknowledgment has
been received by him from the Bank. On the basis of the receipt
on such advice, the Treasury Officer, will verify his records and
if no payment has been made, he will issue the certificate on
non-payment to the drawing officer.

*267A. Letters of credit.—If the Drawing Officer in whose favour a
letter of credit is issued requires funds both at the headquarters and at a sub-
treasury, the Treasury Officer shall provide funds at the sub treasury also.

Order.

(b) Pensions payable at a treasury which transacts its cash business
through the Bank shall be actually disbursed at the Bank or at the treasury in
accordance with the general or special orders of the Government applicable to
each case - See also note under Rule 230 above. When such a pension is to be
disbursed  at  the  Bank,  the  officer-in-charge  of  the  treasury  shall  be  the
Disbursing Officer for the purpose of these rules except in regard to the actual
disbursement of cash on the bill passed for payment by him.

275. (a) Pensioners specially exempted from personal appearance by
the Government (See Rule 126, Part III of the Kerala Service Rules, V Edition),
women  who  are  not  accustomed  to  appear  in  public  and  pensioners  who
produce  satisfactory  evidence  that  they  are  unable  to  appear  because  of
bodily illness or infirmity, need not appear at the treasury in person to claim
payment of their pensions.

      (b) The  pension  due  to  any  pensioner  belonging  to  one  of  the

messenger who presents the pensioner’s half of the Pension Payment Order
along with (1) a proper bill signed and receipted by the pensioner and bearing
an  endorsement  also  duly  signed  by  him  authorizing  payment  to  such

any of the person mentioned in Rule 126 of Part III of the Kerala Service Rules,
V Edition.

277. A disbursing officer shall not pay a pension for any month to a

than the *date on which it is due for payment of that month. He shall also
invariably take the signature of the messenger in whose favour the pensioner
has endorsed the bill in token of the receipt of the amount specified in it.
When the messenger is illiterate, his signature shall be taken in the form of
his thumb impression, duly attested by a witness. The disbursing officer is
personally responsible for any payment wrongly made. Whenever he feels a
doubt  as  to  the  proper  course  of  action  he  should  consult  the Accountant
General.

*This amendment shall come into force w.e.f. 31-8-1981.

278. (a) A pensioner of any description who is resident in India may
claim and draw his pension admissible to him by giving a legally valid power
of  attorney  in  favour  of  another  person  in  India. A  pensioner  desiring  to
receive his pension through another person to whom he has given a valid
power of attorney should endorse a copy of the deed conferring the power of
attorney to his disbursing officer and the audit officer. The person holding the
power of attorney will then prepare and present the bills, making a claim on
behalf of the pensioner and receive the payment on his (the person holding
the power of attorney) giving the quittance. If the person holding the power
of attorney is an agent (including a bank) who has also executed an indemnity
bond agreeing to refund over payments, he can draw the pension for a period
of not more than a year after the date of the life certificate furnished by him
in respect of the pensioner in accordance with the provision of Rule 167. If,
however, the person holding the power of attorney is not an agent (including
a bank) who has executed a bond to refund over payments, he will either
receive the payment in person from the disbursing officer after giving his
quittance, or if he desires to draw the pension through an agent or representative

        RULES  279-280

279. Leper pensioners.—A leper pensioner shall ordinarily appear before
the disbursing officer to claim his pension without preparing a bill. The disbursing
officer shall then direct one of his clerks or assistants to fill up a pension bill form
on behalf of the pensioner. Payment shall be made at once to the pensioner on this
bill, and the disbursing officer shall mark the bill by means of a stamp as having
been paid in his presence and record the fact of payment in both halves of the
Pension Payment Order under his initials. Both halves of the Pension Payment
Order shall be retained in the treasury in these cases.

When a leper pensioner is unable to appear before the disbursing officer
due to bodily infirmity, he shall send a life certificate under Rule 275 but not a

irrespective of any money limit, by postal money order.

280. (a) The disbursing officer shall take adequate precaution to prevent
the payment of any fraudulent claims, on account of the pension of a pensioner
who does not appear in person to take payment. When a pensioner draws his

officer  shall  require  proof  of  his  continued  existence;  independent  of  that
furnished by the life certificate in the monthly pension bill to be furnished at
least once a year. For this purpose he shall require each such pensioner either
to attend in person at the treasury for due indentification at least once a year
or to produce an annual life certificate from persons other than those who
usually furnish life certificate for receiving monthly pension. The annual life
certificate  from  any  Gazetted  Officer,  Village  Officer,  Sub  Registrar,  Sub
Inspector of Police and the Executive Officer of the Panchayat wherein the
pensioner resides, with the respective office seal affixed to the certificate shall
be accepted by the Treasury Officers as independent proof of the existence of
the  pensioner.  The  annual  life  certificate  shall  be  issued  by  the  officers
concerned in the following form:—

year, failing which the payment of pension for * January, as also the pensions
for subsequent months shall be held up until the certificate is received.

exempted  from  personal  appearance  whose  pensions  are  paid  at  the  sub
treasuries.

(c) A pensioner of rank may be identified privately by the disbursing

officer and need not be required to appear at a public office.

(d) The  disbursing  officer  shall  take  special  care  in  regard  to  the
payment of the pension of any woman not accustomed to appear in public,
since such payments involve a special risk of fraud. No payment shall be
made except on a life certificate as prescribed in Rule 275 (b), which shall be
attested  on  each  occasion,  as  an  additional  precaution,  by  two  or  more
respectable persons of the pensioner’s town or village. The disbursing officer
shall also arrange to have every such pensioner examined at least once a year
by two non-pardah female pensioners who shall check her personal marks
with these recorded on the disburser’s half of the Pension Payment Order, and
shall compare her signature, or if she is illiterate her thumb/great-toe-impression
or the receipt with that already taken on the disburser’s half of the Pension
Payment Order. These examination shall be conducted as far as possible without
any extra expenditure by the Government. Extra expenditure may be incurred
in special cases when it is unavoidable.

**(e) The disbursing officer, may at his discretion and for reason to
be  recorded  privately  identify  and  verify  the  continued  existence  of  a
pensioner, and dispense with his personal appearance prescribed in this rule
but this power shall be exercised only in special cases such as of those who
held high office before retirement.

       RULE 286

(iii) The Treasury Officers should arrange for the money order forms
being  written  up  sufficiently  early,  and  presented  to  the  Post  Office  from
**10th of the month onwards. When the number of money order forms to be
booked in Post Offices is very large, the Treasury Officers should contact the
Post  Masters  concerned  and  decide  how  many  filled-up  forms  should  be
presented on each day. The presentation of the forms should be completed
however, by the last working day of the month to which the pension relates.
The forms for a day will be arranged to be delivered in a lot to the Post Office
in a cover addressed to the Post Master. The forms from a treasury should be
presented to the same Post Office on all occasions to facilitate future references,
if any, required. Normally the forms should be presented at the Post Office
nearest  to  the  treasury  where  the  routine  transactions  of  the  treasury  are
carried out. But in cases where the nearest Post Office may not be having
enough number of hands to handle the money order forms in bulk, another
convenient Post Office with the concurrence of the Postal Department may be
fixed for the purpose. He should see that the words “Pension money order not
to be paid before the 1st of ……..” (Here enter the name of the month of
disbursement) are inscribed on the top of each money order form presented in
advance by a rubber stamp.

of the State Government, the relevant service head may be debited with the
amount of pension and transfer credited to the Money Order Personal Deposit
Account in the name of Treasury Officer. The Money Order Commission due
thereon shall be debited under the head of account 2071 and simultaneously
transfer credited to Money Order Personal Deposit Account. In respect of
Pension other than State Pension sent at the cost of the Government or authority
to whom such pensions relate, the Money Order Commission as well as the
amount  payable  to  the  pensioners  shall  be  debited  to  the  concerned
Government  (Central,  Inter-State-Suspense,  Tamil  nadu  etc.)  and  transfer
credited to the Money Order Personal Deposit Account. In respect of pensions
of other Governments paid at the cost of pensioners, the net amount due to
the pensioner after debiting Money Order Commission as well as the amount
of Commission shall be debited to the concerned Government and transfer
credited to the Money Order Personal Deposit Account. The Money Order
Forms in such cases shall be prepared only for the net amount due to the

noting sufficient, details in the Pension Payment Order concerned. Similarly,
the unpaid Money Order Pensions in respect of other State Government should
be credited back to the Inter State Suspense Account of the State concerned.

(v) Separate pension bills need not be prepared for each pensioner.
The payments shall be shown in a separate schedule in Form T.R. 83. The
total amounts of the payments shown in the schedule shall be written both in
figures and in words. The disbursing officer shall satisfy himself that all the
amounts shown as paid in the schedule have actually been remitted by money
order and certify accordingly on it. The disbursing officer shall write his pay
order  on  the  schedule;  it  shall  then  be  stamped  “Paid  by  transfer”  and
forwarded to the Accountant General or the Treasury Officer as the case may
be, with the corresponding list of payments as a voucher supporting the debit
in the treasury accounts.

(vi) The  disbursing  officer  shall  also  see  that  the  payees’  money
order receipts are duly received for all the remittances shown in the register.
He shall compare the signature (or thumb impression) on each such receipt
every  month  with  the  pensioners’  signature  (or  thumb  impression)  on  the
Pension Payment Order and satisfy himself that it is genuine. The receipts
shall then be filed in the treasury. In the next month’s schedule of pension
payments the disbursing officer shall certify as follows:—

“I certify that I have satisfied myself that all pension payments shown
in the schedule for the previous month have been paid to the proper persons
and that I have obtained the payee’s money order receipts in support of all
these payments and filed them in my office.”

6. The Disbursing Officer shall satisfy himself once in a year about the
continued  existence  of  the  pensioner  either  by  personal  appearance  of  the
pensioner before the Disbursing Officer or through life certificates. The Disbursing
Officer shall also note the fact of personal mustering or the receipt of life certificates
as the case may be in both halves of the Pension Payment Order under his dated
signature.

CHAPTER  IV

PERIODICAL  APPEARANCE  OF  PENSIONERS    FOR  IDENTIFICATION

287.

(a) On the first appearance of a pensioner the disbursing officer
shall take an impression of the pensioner’s left hand thumb and fingers or where
this is not possible due to physical incapacity, right hand thumb and fingers or the
impressions of the toe, on the pension bill.

He shall then identify the pensioner with reference to the particulars given in
the  disburser’s  half  of  the  pension  payment  order  and  by  comparison  of  the
thumb and finger impressions with those pasted on the Pension Payment Order.

Once in the course of every year thereafter, the continued existence of the
pensioner shall be ensured by obtaining the above impressions in the pension bill
and an annual life certificate as contemplated under sub rule (a) of Rule 280.

(b) A woman who is exempt from personal appearance under Rule 275
(a) because she is not accustomed to appear in public should affix an impression
of her left thumb/right thumb/great toe on each bill in the presence of the person
who signs the life certificate and the latter should attest it. An illiterate pensioner
should similarly affix an impression of his left thumb/right thumb/great toe on
each bill in the presence of the person who signs the life certificate, or whom he
attends at the paying office in person to receive payment, before the disbursing
officer, and the person who signs the life certificate or the disbursing officer, as the
case may be, should attest it. In the case of an illiterate pensioner or a woman who
is not accustomed to appear in public, quittance by a seal mark attested by some
known  and  respectable  person  may  be  accepted  in  lieu  of  thumb/great  toe
impressions.

(c) When a Pension Payment Order is renewed, the original signature of
thumb and finger/toe impressions shall be cut off from the old order and attached
to the new order.

       RULES 287-289

 (d) If the disbursing officer entertains any doubt as to the identity of
any person claiming to be a pensioner who has served in the Police Department,
he may require the local Inspector of Police to identify him, and the latter shall
then be responsible for the correct identification of the pensioner.

(e) The procedure laid down in sub-rule (vii) of Rule 286 applies
mutatis mutandis to pensioners receiving pension direct from the treasury
also.

288.  (a) In order to ensure that annual mustering/periodical verification
of the pensioners has been done, the disbursing officer shall note the date of
mustering or the date of the life certificate produced at the space provided for
it in both halves of the Pension Payment Order. Similarly he shall write the
letter “L.C.” with his initials against each monthly pension payment whenever
disbursement is made on the strength of life certificate. He shall also send
through the messenger who receives payment of the pension in November a
call in Form T.R. 84 or T.R. 85 for the purpose.

 In the case of re-employed pensioners it will be sufficient if a certificate
from the head of the office or department in which they are re-employed to the
effect that the pensioner is re-employed in his office or department is produced
before the pension disbursing officers.

   (b) When a pensioner draws his pension through an agent who
has executed a bond to refund overpayments, the pension shall not be paid
on account of a period of more than a year after the date of the life certificate
last received. The Accountant General and the disbursing officer shall watch
carefully for authentic information of the death of any such pensioner and see
that no further payment is made after such information is received.

289. Place of payment:—A pension payable in India may be paid at

any treasury in India.

issue  an  authority  for  making  payment  to  the  Treasury  Officer  where  the
payment is desired by the pensioner, if the latter is situated within his audit
circle  or  move Accountant  General  of  the  State  in  which  such  treasury  is
located to arrange for the payment.

(b) Transfer  of  political  pensions:—The  Government  or  the
Accountant  General  may  permit  the  transfer  of  the  payment  of  a  political

The District Treasury Officer is authorised to renew Pension
Payment Order without reference to the Accountant General when the entries
on the reverse of either the pensioner’s or the disburser’s half are completely
filled up or the pensioner’s half is lost, worn or torn. When the renewal is due
to the loss of the original Pension Payment Order, the circumstances of its
loss  should  be  investigated  and  a  fee  of    *`  5  should    be  levied  on  the
pensioner before the duplicate Pension Payment Order is issued, provided
that, if the loss of the original Pension Payment Order is due to accident or
causes beyond the pensioner’s control, or if the pensioner is too poor to pay
the fee the Director of Treasuries may exempt him from payment of the fee.
(See also Note under Rule 134, Part III of the Kerala Service Rules, V Edition.)
The Old Pension Payment Orders, if available, shall be retained by the

disbursing officers for three years and then destroyed.

NOTE 1—The receipted chalan for the fee realized for renewal of Pension
Payment Order should be filed along with the disburser’s half.

District/Sub  Treasury  from  which  he  is  receiving  his
pension, for a duplicate copy thereof. The Sub Treasury
Officer will then forward the application received by him
to the District Treasury Officer along with the Treasury
half of the Pension Payment Order after duly furnishing
his  remarks  on  the  application.  The  District  Treasury
Officer will then conduct such further  enquiries  as are
deemed necessary on such applications and  thereafter,
issue   a   duplicate   of   the  pensioners half, prominently
marked ‘Duplicate’ in red ink.

     Instruction 2—If the disburser’s half of the Pension Payment Order which
should  be  kept  under  the  safe  custody  of  the  Treasury
Officer  is  missing,  the  District  Treasury  Officer/Sub
Treasury  Officer  should  institute  a  thorough  search  to
trace out the Pension Payment Order. If after such thorough
search,  the  Treasury  Officer  is  satisfied  that  the
disburser’s  half  of  the  Pension  Payment  Order  is
irrecoverably lost, the matter should be reported to the
Accountant General, through the District Treasury Officer
in  case  of  Sub Treasury. The  District Treasury  Officer
should send the report to the Accountant General detailing
the circumstances in which the disburser’s half was lost
and request the Accountant General to issue a duplicate.
The Accountant General will then arrange for the issue
of a duplicate prominently marked “Duplicate” in red ink.
Simultaneously,  with  the  sending  of  the  report  to  the
Accountant General, the District Treasury Officer should
fix up the responsibility for the loss and also stop payment
of  the  pension  on  the  Pension  Payment  Order  till  the
disburser’s half is received in the treasury. The penalty
of †`5 should be recovered from the person responsible
for the loss. Instances of such losses should be reported
to  the  Director  of  Treasuries  also.

If the entire amount of arrears is due to one legal heir a claim in the
proper form shall be obtained from him and the amount disbursed to
him. If the amount of arrears is to be disbursed in parts to two or
more persons the full amount of arrears of pension shall be drawn on
a simple receipt by the Treasury Officer (bill form No. T.R. 42) and the
shares  due  to  the  persons  present  on  the  day  may  be  disbursed
obtaining proper acknowledgments which shall be attached to the
vouchers and sent to the Accountant General and the balance shall
be kept under Revenue Deposit so that it can be withdrawn and paid
as a refund of Revenue Deposit as and when the other heirs claim
their shares. A certificate to the effect that the undisbursed balance
has been kept under “Revenue Deposit” shall also be furnished by
the Treasury Officer in the voucher sent to the Accountant General.

The arrears of pension or any share thereof can be disbursed to a
heir by postal money order at the cost of the claimant and at his
written request. In that case the signature of the applicant on the
requisition shall be attested by a Gazetted Officer or some other well-
known and trustworthy person. The maximum limit of  ` 200 fixed in
Rule 286 (A) for the payment of pension by money order is applicable
to this cases.

(a)

303.

The Treasury Officer shall not pay any gratuity except on
an authority received from the Accountant General, to whom, under Rule 152
of Part III of the Kerala Service Rules the sanction is communicated by the
sanctioning authority or by another Audit Officer. The payment can be claimed
on the letter of authority itself and no separate bill is necessary in such cases.

(b) (i) When at the option of the gratuitant, the gratuity is drawn
by the head of an office for disbursement, he shall furnish to the Accountant
General within a month of the date of drawal, a certificate of disbursement.

(ii) At the option of the gratuitant, the gratuity may be drawn by the

drawal,  to  the Accountant  General  with  receipts  and  vouchers  wherever
possible. If only a part of the amount is adjusted and the balance paid in case
to  the  gratuitant,  the  certificate  of  disbursement  shall  be  forwarded,  as
mentioned in sub-rule (i) above, over and above the certificate of adjustment.

(c) If a gratuity remains undrawn for more than twelve months, the
payment order shall be returned to the Accountant General, mentioning the
cause, if known, of the non-appearance of the person entitled to the gratuity.

304. The Government will, while sanctioning a gratuity, communicate
such  order  to  the  officer  submitting  the  gratuity  application  who  should
promptly communicate the sanction to the gratuitant by furnishing him with
a copy of the said order and direct him to apply in person to the treasury at
which the payment of the gratuity is desired. The Accountant General will
separately  issue,  to  the  treasury  concerned,  a  letter  of  authority  to  pay  in
which particulars required for identifying the gratuitant will be furnished. On
the  identification  being  established  and  on  the  gratuitant  producing  his
personal copy of the letter of the Accountant General to the Treasury Officer
authorising payment of the gratuity payment shall be made to him or if the
gratuitant  is  dead  at  the  time  of  payment,  upon  the  receipt  of  the  person
legally entitled to receive the gratuity:

*Provided that the payment of gratuity may be made, without the personal
appearance of the gratuitant through an authorised agent, including a bank,
who shall be required to give the Government, separately in respect of each
payment, a Bond of Indemnity, which shall be duly stamped, in the following
form:—

In  consideration  of  our  being  authorised  to  draw  the  gratuity
…………………………………(name of the gratuitant)in accordance with
gratuity payment order No………………dated …………………..issued by the
Accountant General..........……………….we, the……………… (name of the bank
or agent) hereby engage to refund to the Government of Kerala on demand,

COMMUTATION  OF  PENSIONS

305. (a)   Service Pensions.—(i) The amount payable in commutation of
a civil pension under the Kerala Pensions (Commutation) Rules is payable at
the treasury at which the pension is being, or is to be drawn.

(ii) When a portion only of a civil pension is commuted, the amount of
the  unreduced  pension  due  upto  the  day  preceding  that  on  which  the
commutation takes effect, shall be paid along with the commuted value of the
portion commuted.

NOTE—The above rule applies to the amount payable in commutation of a
civil pension under the Madras Civil Pensions (Commutation) Rules
also.

(b) Revenue  Pensions.—When  a  revenue  pension  is  capitalized  and
paid off, the pensioner shall be paid his or her pension upto the date of payment
of the commuted value. If in any case the commuted value is not paid to the
pensioner before he or she attains the age next birthday, or if the rate of interest on
deposits in the General Provident Fund, etc., adopted for purposes of calculating
the commuted value is varied before the commuted value is paid to the pensioner,
the amount of the commuted value shall be revised. Commutation shall invariably
become absolute on the date of payment of the commuted value.

(c) Political  Pensions.—The  provisions  of  rule  (a)  should  be

followed,  mutatis mutandis, in regard to political pension also.

305A. *  (i) Medical  Allowance  to  Pensioners.—All  State  Service
Pensioners who have completed the age of 65 years shall be paid a medical
allowance at the rate as is ordered by the Government from time to time.
The allowance shall be paid from the first of the month in which the Pensioner
completes the age of 65 years by the District Treasury Officer/Sub Treasury
Officer  based  on  the details regarding date of birth furnished in the Pension
Payments Order and necessary entries thereof made in both halves of Pension
Payment  Orders.

(ii) The Medical Allowance shall be drawn alongwith regular pension
bill for each month. In the bill form and other records of the treasury Medical
Allowance shall be indicated separately. If in any case the date of birth of the
pensioner is not available in the Pension Payment Order, the Treasury Officer

authorised to draw a countersign the bill in Form T.R. 108. The departmental
officer shall attach to the bill a certified copy of the Government sanction.
When  an  authority  subordinate  to  the  Government  sanctions  any  such
expenditure under the powers delegated to it by the Government, the Treasury
Officer should disburse the amount on the authority of the order according
sanction.  Before  making  payment,  the  Treasury  Officer  should  verify  the
signature or countersignature of the departmental officer with the specimen

DOUBTFUL  CLAIMS

(b) A Treasury Officer should not undertake on behalf of the claimant
any correspondence with any authority in regard to a claim which he considers
to be disputable. When he is doubtful whether a claim should be paid or not,
he should take the orders of the **Director of Treasuries who is in general
charge  of  the  treasury.  When  such  a  case  is  referred  to  the  **Director  of
Treasuries he may in his discretion authorize the payment if he is satisfied as
to the validity of the claim after careful examination of all the circumstances of
the  case.  Whenever  the  **Director  of  Treasuries  authorizes  payment  of  a
claim referred to him by the Treasury Officer as being a doubtful claim, he
should immediately report the facts to the Accountant General.

       RULES 308-309

PART VI

TRANSFER OF MONEYS STANDING IN THE
GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT

GENERAL

308. The rules in this Part apply primarily to transfers of Government

moneys-

(a)

from one treasury to another;

(b)

from  the  treasury  balance  to  the  currency  chest  balance  in  a
treasury or vice versa; and

(c)

from a treasury to the Bank or vice versa.

Such transfers are made to prevent any unnecessary locking up of
moneys in treasuries and to replenish treasuries in which the cash balance
has run short. The transfers are facilitated by the maintenance of currency
chests in such district treasuries as do not transact their cash business through
the Bank and in most of the sub treasuries which do not transact their cash
business through the Bank. (See Rules 312* and 313 below).

The detailed procedure to be followed in regard to transfers of funds

of the kinds mentioned above is indicated below:

1.    Resource

309. Maximum normal cash balance.—In January of each year, the
Government fix the maximum normal balance for each district for the next
financial year, i.e., the amount which the total treasury cash balances in the
district should never exceed except in very abnormal circumstances. When
the Government consider it necessary, they may fix a higher figure as the
maximum  normal  balance  for  a  district  for  the  months  of  the  year  when
transactions  are  heavy.  The  maximum  normal  balances  so  fixed  are
communicated  to  the  respective  Treasury  Officers.  The  Treasury  Officer
should then fix the maximum normal balance for each treasury in his district
which maintains a cash balance (i.e., each treasury which does not transact
its cash business through the bank) and submit to the Government a statement
(in duplicate) showing how he has distributed the maximum normal balance
fixed for the district. If he alters this distribution later, he should submit to
the Government a statement (in duplicate) showing the revised distribution.

*Rule 312 Deleted

                                                     KERALA TREASURY CODE
PART  VI

       RULES 309-311

The actual cash balance of a district or a sub treasury should ordinarily
be kept much below the maximum normal balance prescribed for it. The cash
balance in treasuries including the small coin and uncurrent coin held in them
should  be  kept  at  a  minimum  at  all  times  so  that  the  Government's  credit
balance with the Reserve Bank may be as large as possible. The Treasury and
Sub  Treasury  Officers  should,  therefore,  promptly  transfer  any  treasury
balances in the form of notes and rupees which are in excess of requirements
by making deposits into their currency chests. Such transfers from and to
the currency chests should be reported to the Director so as to enable him
to verify whether the Treasury Officers are promptly transferring surpluses
of cash to the currency chests. When a surplus of small coin accumulates in
any  treasury  in  his  district,  the Treasury  Officer  should,  if  possible,  order
that it be remitted within the district to another treasury which needs it or to
the Bank; when that is not possible he should request the Currency Officer,
Madras  to  order  the  remittance  of  the  surplus  to  some  place  outside  the
district (See Rules 317 to 319 and 327 to 334 below).

310. Weekly cash balance reports.—The Treasury Officers of the non-
banking district and sub treasuries should forward a weekly cash balance report
in Form No. T.R. 89 to the Director of Treasuries every Saturday after the close of
business giving the balances for each day of the week. If Saturday happens to be
a holiday, the report   should be despatched on the last working day of the week.
In the report, the reason for retention of cash, if any, in excess of the limits prescribed
and the steps taken to bring down immediately the cash balance within permissible
limits should be clearly stated. Whenever, cases of retention of excess cash are
noticed, the Director of Treasuries will, after investigation report such cases, to
Government for appropriate action. While reporting such cases, the Director should
clearly record his opinion, whether the retention of excess cash was inevitable.

311. Monthly cash balance report.—On the third working day of each
month except April, the Treasury Officer should send a cash balance report
in Form T.R. 35 to the Government in the Finance Department. The report
for March should be despatched not later than the sixth working day of April.
The total balance should be stated in the report in words and its distribution
between  the  district  treasury  and  the  sub  treasuries  should  be  exhibited;  the
report  should  show  separately  the  amounts  held  in  each  of  them  in  each
denomination of notes/coins. In the case of the balance in the district treasury, the
report  should  show  also  the  amount  under  double  locks  and  that  under  the
Treasurer's single lock. The figures entered in the report should be punctuated
and  should  exhibit  units  under  units,  tens  under  tens  and  so  on,  since  any
misplacement of the figures causes great inconvenience when the addition is
checked.

       RULES 311-312

In a district where any treasury transacts its cash business through the
Bank, the report should show only the details of the balances at places at
which the treasury does not transact its cash business through the Bank, but
a  separate  memorandum  should  be  attached  showing  the  amount  of  small
coin of each denomination and the amount of uncurrent coin of each class
held by the Bank as reported by the Agent or Agents on the last day of each
month.

The memorandum on the reverse of Form T.R. 35 should show—

(i) The remittances to other district despatched in the past month,
and those, if any, despatched in previous months for which first
acknowledgments have not been received, with date of despatch
of each remittance; and

(ii)

the remittances received from other districts in the past month
with the dates of despatch and receipt of each remittance and
of the despatch of the first and the final acknowledgments.

This  memorandum  should  show  only  remittances  which  have  been
debited  or  credited  in  the  treasury  accounts,  and  should  not  include
transactions of the following kinds:-

(i) Currency  remittance,  i.e.,  remittances  between  two  currency
chests or between a currency chest and the Issue Department
of the Reserve Bank of India, Madras which do not affect the
treasury  account.

(ii) Remittances not brought to account in the month to which the
report  relates,  unless  they  are  remittances  despatched  in
previous  months  for  which  first  acknowledgments  have  not
been received.

(iii) Exchanges of one kind of money held in the treasury balance for
another  kind  taken  from  the  currency  chest.  (The  deposit  of
money into and withdrawal of money from the currency chest
on account of any such exchange should be done on the same
day, and should not be shown in the treasury account.)

The Director is responsible for seeing that the cash balance report is
submitted punctually; and delay in submitting it will be treated as a serious
treasury irregularity.

       RULES 313-314

SUPPLY  OF  FUNDS  TO  TREASURIES  AND  SUB  TREASURIES

General

313. The currency chests maintained at treasuries contain rupees and

notes which belong to the Reserve Bank of India.

A permanent currency chest is maintained at each district treasury and
at each sub treasury where the transactions are of such a magnitude that the
additional facility for the transfer of funds thus afforded will make it possible
to avoid locking up money unnecessarily in the treasury balance or to reduce
the frequency of remittances of coin and notes. When however, the treasury
transacts its cash business through a branch of State Bank of India (acting as
the  agent  of  the  Reserve  Bank)  or  a  branch  of  State  Bank  of  Travancore
(acting as the agent of the State Bank of India), the currency chest is kept in
the sole custody of the State Bank of India or the State Bank of Travancore,
as the case may be, and the Government are in no way concerned with the
operations on it.

When  a  sub  treasury  has  no  permanent  currency  chest,  a  temporary
currency  chest  should,  ordinarily  be  opened  during  the  land  revenue
collecting  season  in  order  that  money  received  in  excess  of  requirements
may be transferred immediately to the Government's account with the Reserve
Bank by making deposits in the currency chest. Temporary currency chests
for purposes other than meeting the requirements of the revenue collecting
season may also be opened at sub treasuries for periods not exceeding six
months. The District Treasury Officer has power to order the opening of a
temporary  currency  chest  at  a  sub  treasury  in  his  district  when  necessary.
He should report the opening of a temporary chest and the amount of the
first deposit into it by telegram to the Currency Officer.

314. Under the provisions of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (India
Act II of 1934), the total amount of the currency and Bank notes in circulation,
which constitute the liabilities of the Issue Department of the Bank, should
not exceed the assets held by the Issue Department in gold, sterling securities,
rupee coin and rupee securities. A part of these assets is held in the currency
chests in the various treasuries in the form of rupee coin. The notes held in the
currency  chests  are  not  notes  in  circulation  and  pass  into  circulation  only
when they are transferred to the treasury balances. The deposit of notes into

261

                                                     KERALA TREASURY CODE
PART  VI

       RULES 314-315

a currency chest decreases the amount of notes in circulation i.e., the liabilities
of the Issue Department of the Bank, and the deposit of rupees into a currency
chest increases the assets of the Issue Department of the Bank. A deposit of
notes  and/or  rupees  into  a  currency  chest  thus  enables  the  Bank  to  issue
notes  and/or  rupees  from  a  currency  chest  elsewhere  upto  the  amount
deposited without affecting the adequacy of the assets of the Issue Department
of the Bank in relation to its liabilities. Similarly, the effect of a withdrawal from
a currency chest may be cancelled by an equal deposit into another currency
chest.

In a district in which there is no treasury which transacts its cash business
through  the  Bank,  every  operation  on  a  currency  chest  is  balanced  by  an
"opposite transfer" carried out in another currency chest situated either at the
headquarters of the district or within the district.

In a district in which there is at least one treasury which transacts its
cash business through the Bank, every operation on a currency chest which
is in the sole custody of the Government is balanced by an "opposite transfer"
carried out under the instructions of the Currency Officer at the Madras Office
of the Reserve Bank between its currency chest and the Government's account
with the Banking Department of the Bank. The effect of an operation on such
a currency chest together with the "opposite transfer" in Madras is from the
Government's point of view, a remittance from the treasury balance to the
Government's account with the Reserve Bank or vice versa.

315. Treasuries  which  do  not  transact  their  cash  business  through
the Bank.—The Treasury Officer is responsible for keeping sufficient funds
to meet disbursements at each treasury in his district which does not transact
its cash business through the Bank, and for seeing that the treasury balance
at each such treasury is kept as low as possible at all times, so that no money
is locked up unnecessarily and the Government's balance with the Reserve
Bank is always as high as possible.

NOTE—The Currency Officer will be responsible for maintaining the required
form of currency chests. It is the duty of the Treasury Officer to see
that  currency  chests  at  district  and  sub  treasuries  are  adequately
stocked with notes and rupees to meet all reasonable demands for
change.

PART  VI

       RULES 315-317

As far as possible, all transfers of funds from and to the treasury balance
at a treasury which has a currency chest should be made only through the
currency  chest  and  actual  remittances  should  be  limited  to  remittances  of
small coin and uncurrent coin (See Rules 327 to 331 below).

316. Treasuries  which  transact  their  cash  business  through  the
Bank.—At a district treasury which transacts its cash business through the
Bank the Manager or Agent of the Bank, as the case may be, is responsible
for the provision of funds to meet disbursements on account of Government
transactions.  In  order  to  enable  him  to  make  the  necessary  provision,  the
Treasury Officer should send him on each Saturday a statement showing as
accurately as possible for each of the following two weeks:-

1. the probable receipts and disbursements on Government account

at the district treasury; and

2. the  probable  receipts  from  or  remittances  to  sub  treasuries  at

the  district  treasury.

The  Treasury  Officer  should  also  inform  the  Bank  at  once  of  any
expected  payment  exceeding   `  20,000  in  amount,  as  soon  as  he  receives
information that the payment will have to be made.

This instruction applies mutatis mutandis to sub treasuries which transact

their cash business through the Bank.

II.      Remittances

317. Transfers and remittances of moneys standing in the Government

account are of the following kinds, namely:—

A.    TRANSFERS  THROUGH  CURRENCY

A transfer through currency is a transfer of money between the treasury
balance and the currency chest at one place in consideration of an opposite
transfer  of  the  same  amount  at  another  place,  e.g.,  a  transfer  at  a  district
treasury against an opposite transaction at a sub treasury in the same district
and  a  transfer  at  a  treasury  against  an  opposite  transaction  at  the  Reserve
Bank in Madras under the instruction of the Currency Officer.

PART  VI

       RULE 317

B.    REMITTANCES  OF  COIN,  NOTES

These comprise—

(i) Bank remittances, i.e., remittances from the Bank to a treasury

which does not transact its cash business through the Bank or vice versa.

(ii) Remittances  between  treasuries,  i.e.,  remittances  from  the
treasury balance at one treasury to the treasury balance at another treasury.

NOTE—This method of remittance applies only to remittances to and from
sub  treasuries  where  there  is  no  currency  chest  and  to  the
remittances  of  small  coin,  uncurrent  coin  and  foreign  notes  and
coin  between  treasuries.

(iii) Small  coin  depot  remittances,  i.e.,  remittances  of  small  coin

from a small coin depot to a treasury or vice versa.

NOTE—Remittances from one small coin depot to another are purely central
transactions and the procedure prescribed in the Central Treasury
Rules should be followed in regard to such remittances.

(iv) Mint  remittances  i.e.,  remittances  of  uncurrent  coin,  or  coin

withdrawn from circulation, from a treasury to a Mint.

NOTE—Currency remittances i.e., remittances of notes or rupees from one
currency chest to another or between a currency chest and the Issue
Department  of  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India,  Madras,  do  not  affect
the Government account since the contents of the currency chests
are  property  of  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India. A  remittance  of  this
kind  does  not  involve  locking  up  any  Government  funds,  and
remittances of notes or rupees should therefore be sent wherever
possible, as currency remittances. Subject to any general or special
instructions that may be issued in this behalf by the Currency Officer,
Madras,  the  provisions  of  Rules  324  to  368  below  regarding
remittances  of  coin  and  notes  should  be  followed  in  regard  to
currency remittances also.

normal balance prescribed for it (See Rule 309 above), the Treasury Officer
shall deposit the amount in excess of immediate requirements into the currency
chest.  When  additional  funds  are  required  to  meet  net  disbursements,  the

of immediate requirements into the currency chest, unless he expects that heavy
net disbursements will absorb it within the next two or three days.

(ii) The Sub Treasury Officer shall, at once, send a report in Form
T.R. 38 of each deposit into the currency chest to the Treasury Officer. On
receipt,  of  the  report  the  Treasury  Officer  shall  make  the  corresponding

(iii) When the Sub Treasury Officer requires funds to replenish the sub
treasury balance, he shall apply to the Treasury Officer for sanction to a transfer

the transfer of funds is necessary he shall transfer the amount required from the
treasury balance to the, currency chest at the district treasury and authorize the
Sub Treasury Officer to make a corresponding transfer from the currency chest to
the treasury balance at the sub treasury.

at least ten yards long. The officer-in-charge of the escort shall see that the
rope is never detached from the box and that it is not knotted or entangled in
any way so long as the box is on board a boat. When the treasure is shipped
on a sea going vessel, the despatching officer shall remove the buoys after
the boxes are shipped and the receiving officer shall attach the buoys when

receipt on each copy of the invoice stating that he has received the boxes of
the marks and weights detailed therein.

NOTE—Separate  invoices  shall  be  prepared  for  treasury  and  currency

(i) For coin remittances—One Treasurer upto `10 lakhs

One Treasurer for every additional  `10 lakhs or fraction of that

(ii) For note remittances—One Treasurer

When only one Treasurer is admissible according to the above scale for

remain in charge whilst it is being examined at the receiving office.

(c) When a remittance of coin or notes or both is especially heavy,
the remitting officer may with the sanction of the Currency Officer, depute
one  or  more  clerks  to  accompany  it  in  addition  to  the  usual  escort  of
Treasurers.

(d) The remitting officer may, with the sanction of the Collector,
engage any extra Treasurers required for accompanying remittance or to take
the place of permanent Treasurers deputed to accompany remittances. When
it is not possible to engage men within the district for service as temporary
Treasurers, he may engage men from outside the district.

NOTE— The term “Treasurer” occurring in this rule and in rules 337 to 375

includes an Assistant Treasurer also.

one is secured by double-locks, one key shall be held by the Treasurer and
the other by the escort officer. If there is only one lock, the key shall be held by
the Treasurer, but the escort officer shall be responsible for not allowing the
chest or wagon to be opened before arrival at the destination, save in the case

without a Treasurer, single locks shall be used and the keys shall be entrusted
to the escort officer in a sealed cover, which he shall not open except when
absolutely necessary, e.g., in the case of a breakdown en route.

(ii) Treasurers accompanying remittances of withdrawn silver coin
and  remittances  for  special  examination  to  the  Mints  shall  be  released  by
the Mint authorities as soon as the numbers of sealed boxes in the remittances
have  been  checked  with  the  relative  invoices  and  found  satisfactory  and
correct; and on no account, shall they be detained to watch the examination
of any remittance at the Mints.

339. Receipt  of  remittance.—

(a) Immediately on receipt of a remittance from outside the district,
the Treasury Officer should send an advice to the Currency Officer stating

remittance.  If  a  postal  advice  will  not  reach  the  Currency  Officer  within
twenty-four hours, a telegraphic advice should be sent.

(b) On  receipt  of  a  remittance,  each  box  contained  in  it  shall  be
weighed in the presence of the escort officer and the Treasury Officer and
the weight so ascertained shall be compared with that shown in the invoice. If
the two weights tally for each box a receipt in the form prescribed in paragraph
7 of Appendix 18 shall be given to the escort officer and he shall be allowed to
return at once. A copy of the receipt shall be sent by post on the same day to
the despatching office.

officer, and the breach of the rule requiring the weights of the boxes to be
stated separately shall be brought to the notice of the remitting officer. If the
weight of any box does not tally with that stated in the invoice or if any box
shows signs of having been tampered with, it shall be opened in the presence
of  the  escort  officer  and  its  contents  examined  before  the  escort  officer  is
released.  If  any  box  is  so  opened,  the  facts  shall  be  entered  on  the  receipt
together with particulars of the contents of the box as ascertained by counting.

            RULE 340

340. After the preliminary examination of the particulars given in the
invoices has been completed, the boxes shall all be opened (if they have not
already been opened) whether, the remittance is accompanied by a Treasurer
or not. When a Treasurer has accompanied the remittance, the boxes shall
be  opened  in  his  presence.  If  the  detailed  examination  of  the  whole
remittance  is  not  to  be  proceeded  with  immediately,  the  bags  of  coin  or
parcels  of  notes  shall  be  deposited  in  the  strongroom  under  double  locks
care being taken, as far as practicable, to place them apart from other treasure.
When a remittance is expected to remain unexamined in a strongroom for
sometime  and  it  cannot  be  separately  secured  in  a  chest,  or  chests  steps
shall be taken to guard against any abstraction of coin from the remittance.
In such a case, if the amount of the remittance does not exceed  ` 5 lakhs and
the procedure will not cause practical inconvenience, the entire contents of
each  bag  shall  be  weighed  under  the  supervision  of  the  Treasury  Officer
before the remittance is deposited in the strongroom. It may not be possible
to  weigh  the  contents  of  each  bag  when  the  amount  of  such  a  remittance
exceed  ` 5 lakhs. When a remittance remains unexamined for sometime and
the contents of each bag not weighed the Treasury Officer shall satisfy himself
that the remittance has not been tampered with by picking out a number of
boxes and bags from time to time and having their contents weighed under his
supervision. In such cases care shall also be taken to cover completely with
tarpaulins all bags forming part of the remittance, and to secure any notes
which have been unpacked in a chest or chests or replace them in the original
boxes and fasten the lids securely.

Exception—1

Exception—2

When coin or notes contained in remittance are to be
despatched  to  another  treasury  within  a  few  days  of
the  receipt  of  the  remittance,  the  boxes  need  not  be
opened but may be deposited in the strongroom as they
are,  provided  that  they  are  in  good  order  and  are  in
the  charge  of  a  Treasurer  who  will  be  available  to
accompany  them  to  their  final  destination.

New nickel or bronze coin received either directly from
the Mint or from any other treasury in the original Mint
boxes may be accepted as correct without opening the
boxes, provided that the boxes are numbered and the
seals  bear  a  distinct  impression  and  that  both  boxes
and  seals  are  intact  at  the  time  of  receipt.

       RULES 341-344

341. The detailed examination of the contents of the remittance shall
be  conducted  in  the  presence  of  the  treasurer  who  accompanied  the
remittance,  and  under  the  supervision  of  the  Treasurer  of  the  receiving
treasury  or  some  responsible  person  acting  on  his  behalf.  If,  however,  no
Treasurer has accompanied the remittance from the remitting treasury, the
detailed examination shall be conducted in the immediate presence and under
the personal supervision of the Treasurer of the receiving treasury, who shall
see that the interests of the remitting treasury are adequately safeguarded.

(a)

342.

Every  facility  shall  be  given  to  the  Treasurer  of  the
remitting office to watch the examination of the remittance. Any complaint
which  he  makes  shall  be  reported  at  once  to  the  Treasury  Officer.  If  any
fraud  is  suspected,  the  treasurer  or  treasurers  who  are  examining  the
remittance shall be searched in the presence of the Treasurer of the remitting
office.

(b) Only  such  portion  of  the  remittance  shall  be  taken  out  of  the
strongroom as can be examined during the course of the day. When a portion
of the remittance remains unexamined, the Treasurer of the remitting treasury
may, if he so desires, be allowed at the time of the closing of the strongroom
to place a lock of his own on the chest containing the unexamined portion,
or, if that is not possible, on the outside door of the strongroom.

343. The  notes  and  coin  contained  in  a  remittance  shall  be  counted
and examined in detail, so as to ensure not only that they are all genuine but
also that each bundle of notes or bag of coin contains the alleged number. In
the case of remittances of fresh notes send from the Issue Department of the
Reserve Bank of India in bundles of 1,000 pieces, the bundles shall be split up
into packets of 100 notes each. Any light weight or other uncurrent or defective
coin found in the course of the detailed examination of a remittance of current
coin shall be separated and dealt with in accordance with the rules in Chapter
II of Part VIII. Deficiencies, whether in numbers or due to counterfeit notes or
coin, shall be dealt with according to the procedure laid down in Rule 347.

344. As the examination of each bundle or bag is completed, the slip in
Form T.R. 30 or T.R. 31, as the case may be, contained in it shall be taken out
and replaced by a fresh slip prepared by the receiving treasury. The slips from
those bags and bundles the contents of which have been found correct shall
be handed over to the Treasury Officer and immediately destroyed by him;
the remaining slips shall be attached to the report to be sent to the remitting
treasury (See Rule 349). When, however, a remittance of coin is received from

       RULES 344-347

the Issue Department of the Reserve Bank of India, the Treasury Officer shall
return  all  the  slips  to  the  Currency  Officer  after  the  remittance  has  been
examined.

345. The  Treasury  Officer  shall  supervise  the  examination  of  the
remittance  generally  and  see  that  adequate  safeguards  are  taken  by  the
Treasurer during the examination to prevent any malpractices by the Treasurer
of  the  remitting  office  or  the  treasurers  who  examine  the  remittance.  The
Treasury Officer shall put away the notes and coin which have been examined
under double-locks in the treasury or in the currency chest, as the case may
be,  following  the  procedure  laid  down  in  Rules  144  and  151.  When  the
detailed  examination  of  the  remittance  has  been  completed,  the  Treasury
Officer shall send a formal report to the remitting officer showing the result
of the examination.

346. The  examination  of  a  remittance  shall  be  conducted  as
expeditiously as possible in order that the Treasurer who accompanied the
remittance may be relieved as early as possible and unnecessary expenditure
on his daily allowance avoided, and also in order that any deficiency may be
recovered from the Treasurer of the remitting treasury. For the examination
of heavy remittances of coin additional treasurers may be engaged with the
special sanction of the Director. The minimum amount of coin or notes of
any one denomination to be examined by a Treasurer in a day is specified in
Appendix 19.

(a)

347.

If  a  deficiency  discovered  at  a  treasury  on  a  detailed
examination of a remittance received from another treasury is not immediately
made good by the Treasurer of the remitting treasury, it shall be charged in the
accounts as a distinct item with full particulars; these full particulars shall also
be intimated to the Treasury Officer of the remitting treasury, and he shall
recover the amount and credit it in his own treasury.

(b) A deficiency discovered at the Bank (including the Issue
Department of the Reserve Bank of India) in a remittance received from a
treasury shall be made good from the cash balance of the receiving office and
shown as expenditure on Government account under advice to the remitting
treasury  for  recovery  and  credit  in  its  accounts.  Similarly  a  deficiency
discovered at a treasury in a remittance from the Bank (including the Issue
Department of the Reserve Bank of India) shall be made good from the treasury
balance under advice to the remitting office, which shall credit the amount to
Government account.

       RULES 347-351

(c) The  remitting  treasury  shall  be  responsible  for  any  shortage
discovered at the Mint or at a small coin depot in a remittance from a treasury.

(d) The  Accountant  General  shall  watch  the  recovery  of  all

deficiencies discovered in remittances.

348.    All  excesses  found  in  a  remittance  shall  be  returned  to  the
remitting treasury through the attending treasurer, or, if this is not possible,
by registered post or by money order, the cost being borne by the remitting
treasury.

349.   Every defect or deficiency discovered during the examination of a
remittance shall be entered in the slip pertaining to the bag of coin (Rule 327) or
bundle  of  notes  (Rule  334)  concerned  and  shall  be  specially  reported  to  the
remitting officer direct. The report shall be sent to the remitting officer together
with the slip or slips concerned immediately on the close of the examination (or, if
it is a prolonged, one, at the close of the day) so that the remitting officer may be
able to fix the responsibility for the deficiency. If a Treasurer of the remitting office
is present to witness the examination, he shall attest the entries on the slip as they
are made, and shall be allowed, if he so desires, to make good any deficiency, if he
makes good any deficiency, the fact shall be noted on the slip and in the report. If
no Treasurer of the remitting office is present at the examination, the report shall
state the name and rank of the officer who personally supervised the examination.
When any bad coin or notes have to be returned to the remitting office, they shall
be made over to the Treasurer of that office or, if that is not possible, sent by
insured post at the cost of the remitting treasury. If any bag of coin or bundle of
notes is received without a slip or is defective in any other way, a special report
shall be sent immediately to the remitting officer.

350. When the number of rupee or half rupee coins which have lost
more than 2 per cent in weight but not more than 6¼ per cent or 12½ per cent
respectively (See Instructions in Chapter II of Part VIII) detected in any bag
during examination of a remittance exceeds half a per cent of its contents, the
number of such coins found in the bag shall be noted on the slip relating to it,
and the slip shall be sent to the remitting office with a report in the manner laid
down in Rule 349.

351. When new copper, nickel or bronze coin is received either directly
from Mint or from another treasury in the original mint boxes, any excess or
deficiency found on the examination of any box shall be immediately reported
and  the  printed  slip  of  contents  shall  be  forwarded  to  the  Mint  Master

278

       RULES 351-356

concerned. The report shall state the number of the box in which the excess or
deficiency was found and the condition of the box on delivery.

352. When the detailed examination of a remittance has been completed,
the Treasurer who accompanied it should take back to the remitting office the
locks, and if convenient, the bags also. If the police guard which escorted the
treasure returns to the station from which the remittance was despatched, the
tumbrels  of  chests  should  be  sent  back  to  the  remitting  treasury  under  its
charge; otherwise the Treasurer of the remitting treasury should take these
back too.

353. All charges incurred in connection with remittance of coin and
notes to and from treasuries, whether as currency remittances or as treasury
remittances, are borne by the Reserve Bank, subject to the conditions and
exceptions mentioned in Rules 354 to 356.

354. Charges  relating  to  remittances  between  two  treasuries  neither
which  has  a  currency  chest  should  be  borne  by  the  Government.  Charges
relating to the remittance of uncurrent coin between such treasuries, when
sent separately, should, however, be borne by the Reserve Bank.

355. The pay of permanent treasurers and of extra treasurers engaged
on a temporary basis to deal with heavy receipts of remittances should be
met  by  the  receiving  treasury  and  not  debited  to  the  Reserve  Bank. All
temporary treasurers should be paid at the rates fixed by the Government.
The pay of temporary treasurers engaged under Rule 336 (d) to accompany
remittances or to take the place of permanent treasurers, who are deputed to
accompany remittances should be debited to the Reserve Bank. The traveling
allowance of all treasurers, whether permanent or temporary, who accompany
any  remittance  other  than  one  between  two  treasuries  where  there  is  no
currency chest should be debited to the Reserve Bank.

356. Travelling allowances of Treasurers, Clerks, etc., who accompany

remittance.—

(a) When  treasurers  or  clerks  are  sent  with  treasure  or  currency
remittances, the remitting Treasury Officer should furnish them with a certificate
in Form T.R. 93 with columns (1) to (8) filled in. The officer receiving the
remittance  should  estimate  with  reference  to  the  amount  and  kind  of  the
remittance received and the number of men available at his office for examining
it, the period for which the treasurers or clerks accompanying it are likely to be

279

       RULES 356-357

detained at the receiving office, and intimate it to them in writing so as to
enable them to make suitable arrangements for their stay in the station. After
finishing  the  examination  of  the  remittance,  the  receiving  officer  should
complete the certificate in Form T.R. 93 and return it to the remitting treasury.
If the halt has exceeded ten days, he should state in column (12) the daily
allowance which he recommends for the period in excess of ten days and
explain the reasons for his recommendation on the reverse of the certificate. A
certificate in Form T.R. 93 should be attached to every bill for the traveling and
other allowances of treasurers or clerks deputed to accompany a remittance.

(b) When a halt exceeds ten days, the Officer of the Reserve Bank of
India  authorised  for  the  purpose,  or  when  the  charges  are  debited  to  the
Government, the Treasury Officer will decide whether full daily allowance
should be granted for the period in excess of ten days or whether a reduced
rate  should  be  allowed.  In  the  case  of  charges  debitable  to  the  Bank,  the
Currency Officer will deal with claims relating to a halt exceeding ten days
but not exceeding one month, and the Chief Accountant of the Reserve Bank
will deal with claims relating to a halt exceeding one month. On receipt of
the certificate (Form T.R. 93) from the receiving officer, the Treasury Officer
should forward it to the Currency Officer for necessary action if there has
been a halt in excess of ten days and the charges are debitable to the Reserve
Bank.  The  authority  competent  to  deal  with  the  claim  should  indicate  in
column 13 of the certificate the rate at which daily allowance may be drawn
for the period in excess of ten days comprised in any one halt.

(c) When a person from outside the district is engaged as a temporary
treasurer  under  Rule  336  (d),  traveling  allowance  should  be  paid  at  the
ordinary rates for his journey from his residence to the place of appointment.

357. The Treasury Officer who despatches a remittance may grant to a
Treasurer or other treasury official who is to accompany it an advance of
travelling allowance upto the amount likely to be incurred for his journey. If, in
any  case  the  amount  advanced  proves  insufficient,  the  receiving  treasury
may, on the application of the treasurer or other treasury official concerned,
pay him such further advance as may be necessary. An advance made by the
receiving treasury should not be met from the Treasury Officer’s permanent
advance but should be drawn from the treasury and charged in the accounts
and the particulars should be reported to the remitting treasury at once, so
that the latter may recover the amount from the travelling allowance bill to
which relates.

PART  VI

       RULES 357-362

A  Treasury  Officer  is  not  authorised  to  make  any  advance  of  travelling
allowance to a clerk or shroff of the Reserve Bank who accompanies a remittance.

If a Currency Officer receiving a remittance from a treasury grants an advance
of travelling allowance to a treasury official accompanying the remittance, the
amount of the advance will be noted on the treasury official’s certificate with the
Currency Officer’s signature. The remitting treasury should deduct this amount
from the travelling allowance bill of the government servant concerned. Such
advances will only be made by a Currency Officer in exceptional circumstances.

358. All contingent charges incurred at the station where a remittance
is received, such as labour charges, cart or boat hire should be paid by the
receiving officer and charged in his accounts. The remitting officer should not
meet such charges.

Additional Rules for Remittances by Railway

359. When a large remittance is to be despatched by railway, notice
shall be given before hand to the railway authorities at the station of despatch,
so that a wagon or wagons of convenient size may be made available at the
right time.

360. When treasure is loaded for despatch by railway, the doors on one
side of the wagon shall, if possible, be secured from inside and all doors that
can be opened from outside shall be secured by good padlocks. The Treasury
Officer shall supply the padlocks and take an acknowledgment from the escort
officer for them. A sufficient stock of padlocks shall be maintained in each
treasury from which remittances are sent by railway.

361. Small remittances need not be sent by wagon, but may be sent in
the same compartment in which the escort in charge of the remittance travels.
An escort traveling in charge of currency or Bank notes not sent by wagon
shall have the box in the same carriage and shall sit in the end compartment of
the carriage with the box under the seat against the outer planking. If the box is
too large to go under the seat, the use of a whole compartment shall be reserved
on the usual terms.

362. The Treasury Officer (or a responsible government servant deputed
by him for the purpose) shall, jointly with the Police Officer deputed to travel in
charge of the escort by railway, superintend the loading of the wagons. He
shall also hand over to that officer a copy of the memorandum of instructions
printed in Appendix 18 and as many blank receipts as there will be reliefs en
route and shall take his receipt for these documents.

281

PART  VI

       RULES 363-365

363. The strength of the escort deputed to accompany a remittance to
the railway station of despatch and to protect the loading shall be determined
in accordance with the general or special orders of the Government regarding
the escorting of such a sum by road. The receiving officer shall arrange for a
fresh escort of a strength determined in the same way to meet the remittance
at  the  railway  station  where  it  is  to  leave  the  railway.  During  the  railway
journey the treasure shall be protected by a guard of reduced strength fixed
in  accordance  with  the  general  or  special  orders  of  the  government.  The
guard shall be accommodated in an adjoining brake van if the remittance is
carried by goods train, and otherwise in the end compartment of the carriage
next and adjoining the wagon containing the treasure. Neither door of the
compartment occupied by the escort shall be locked. The general principle
to be observed in fixing the strength of the guard for a railway journey is
that ordinarily it shall never be less than a Petty Officer with two men and
that, when the remittance is loaded in more than one wagon, two men shall
be allowed to each wagon. When a wagon containing treasure is to be detached
from the train for any reason, the Station Master or the Guard in charge of
the train will warn the Police guard in charge of the treasure in order that the
necessary arrangements may be made to guard it.

364. As the members of the Police guard in charge of a remittance have
to be constantly on duty, the Police Department shall arrange to relieve them
at convenient points on the journey, allotting to each party a stage of about
twelve hours with due regard to any general or special instructions that have
been issued as to the exact length of particular stages. When an escort officer
starts a railway journey in charge of a remittance, he shall telegraph to his
relieving officer the probable times of his arrival at the station where he is to
be relieved.

(a)

365.

The  receiving  officer  should  make  the  necessary
arrangements for the transport of the treasure at destination so as to avoid
delay at the railway station and inconvenience to the Police Department.

     (b)

The receiving officer should return the padlocks which were
used on the doors of the railway wagons to the remitting treasury through the
escort officer if he is returning to the station where the remitting treasury is
situated. Otherwise, the receiving officer should give the escort officer a receipt
for these padlocks and return them as soon as possible through the treasurer
of the remitting treasury or, if no treasurer accompanied the remittance, by
parcel post or railway parcel.

(1)

366.

The railway fares and freight may be paid in cash or by
warrent or credit note according to local practice. In the case of cash payment,
the police or other officer may obtain from the treasury a sufficient amount as
an advance to be accounted for afterwards. The remitting officer or the officer
arranging the remittance will ascertain the nature and extent of accommodation
required  for  the  purpose  without  unnecessarily  increasing  the  cost  of
remittance, and send the following requisition to the railway authorities.

  “To  the  Station  Master……………….…..Conveyance  by  railway
to……....………is required for treasure belonging to the Government/Reserve
Bank of India to the value of ……………………lakhs of rupees loaded for
……………………………..and contained in ………………………wagons.”

(2) The Station Master will give the officer commanding the guard a
paper notifying that he is in charge of treasure loaded in so many wagons.

NOTE 1—The requisition mentioned above must not be confounded with
the notice to be sent beforehand to the railway authorities, in
order that the necessary wagons may be provided.

NOTE 2—Treasure should always be booked through to the final station,
and the officer who makes the requisition should inform the
railway authorities that he has provided reliefs for the guard at
specified stations.

367. Remittances of nickel, bronze or copper coin shall be booked at
railway  risk,  provided  they  do  not  exceed  the  limits  prescribed  under  the
Indian Railway Coaching Tarrif Rules. Consignments exceeding the prescribed
limits are required to be escorted-Vide Rule 359.

368.

(a) A remittances of currency or Bank notes by sea shall be
sent in the charge of an escort, if freight is paid at cargo rates; in that case, the
value of the notes shall not be entered in the bill of lading but only the number
of pieces. If it is cheaper to pay freight at the rate for specie and the steamer
company will then accept responsibility for the face value of the notes, the
freight  shall  be  paid  at  the  rate  for  specie  and  no  escort  need  be  sent.  If,
however, in any case the steamer company will not accept responsibility for
the face value of the notes even if freight is paid at the rate for specie, the
remittance shall be sent as ordinary cargo at cargo rates in charge of an escort,
although this course may entail some additional expense.

(b) Remittances of coin by sea shall ordinarily be sent insured or at

the shipping company’s risk without an escort.

(c) Remittances  of  notes  or  of  silver  coin  of  any  description  by
inland steamer shall be sent uninsured under the protection of an adequate
escort.

(d) The consignee shall arrange to take delivery of the treasure on
arrival at the station to which it is booked; otherwise it will be carried on to
the next station at the consignee’s risk and the consignee will have to pay
the demurrage charges.

Remittances  to  and  from  Branches  of  the  State  Bank  of  India  and  its
subsidiary  the  State  Bank  of  Travancore

369. Rules 324 to 368 apply mutatis mutandis to remittances to and
from a Branch of the State Bank of India including its subsidiary, the State
Bank of Travancore, transacting the cash business of a treasury, subject to
the modifications indicated in the following rules, (rules 370 to 374) and to
any instructions issued by the Reserve Bank.

370. When the Agent of a branch of the State Bank wishes to remit
surplus notes or coin from the currency chest or surplus small coin from his
balance, or desires that a remittance of notes or coin be sent to his branch, he
will report the particulars to the Madras Local Head Office of the State Bank.
The Local Head Office will communicate with the Currency Officer and issue
orders to the Agent regarding the remittance; if the remittance concerns the
Treasury Officer, the Currency Officer will issue orders to him simultaneously.

371. The agent of a branch of the State Bank will supply the Treasury
Officer of the district, on request, with any coin and notes required for remittance
to a sub treasury in the district (whether as a treasury or a currency remittance),
except when the Currency Officer has decided that it is more convenient to
supply coin and notes direct to a sub treasury from the Issue Department of
the Reserve Bank of India or from a treasury or a branch of the State Bank in
another district.

372. All charges incurred in connection with remittances of coin and
notes to and from branches of the State Bank are met by the Reserve Bank.

373. The procedure prescribed in Rules 324 to 334 for the packing and
despatch of remittances should be observed by the branches of the Bank, but

            RULE 373

in the absence of special arrangements to the contrary made with the Agent,
the  Treasury  Officer  should  arrange  for  the  actual  conveyance  and,  when
necessary, for the escorting of the remittance. The State Bank should bear the
cost of any treasures (shroffs) engaged to deal with heavy receipts, but may
engage temporary shroffs to accompany remittances at the cost of the Reserve
Bank in accordance with the provisions of Rule 336 (a) after obtaining the
sanction of the Currency Officer when it is required under that rule. The power
vested in the Collector by Rule 336 (d) to employ additional treasurers does
not apply to treasuries which transact their cash business through the Bank.
The provisions of Rule 356 regarding halts by treasurers of the treasury do
not apply to shroffs, employed by the State Bank; their daily allowance is
regulated by the Bank’s rules.

NOTE 1—The charges for remittance of the following kinds shall be borne

by the Government:—

(i)

(ii)

remittances  to/from  currency  chests  from/to  sub  treasuries
having no currency chest;

both ends;

(iii) when not sent separately, remittances of uncurrent coins between
treasuries and sub treasuries without currency chests at both
ends;  and

(iv)

remittances of small coins between regular small coin depots
and treasuries or sub treasuries with no currency chests.

(iv) all remittances made under the orders of the Currency Officer
provided  such  remittances  are  between  treasuries  and  sub
treasuries having currency chests or between small coin depots
and such treasuries and sub treasuries.

NOTE 3—The  Officers-in-charge  of  the  Bank  conducting  despatch  of
Government  treasure  are  competent  to  place  requisitions  for
police escorts directly to police authorities. *The charges for
police escorts shall be paid directly by the bank to the police
authorities.

374. The following rules should be observed in the examination of a
remittance of coin or notes made to the Bank from a treasury. They should be
fully explained to every treasurer who accompanies a remittance made to the
Bank:—

(a) All boxes should be weighed on receipt of a remittance. The result
of  the  weighment  should  be  entered  on  the  receipt  given  to  the  officer  or
treasurer in charge of the remittance.

(b) The remittance should be examined in a room separate from the
general business of the Bank, or, if a separate room cannot be made available,
at some distance away from the place where the ordinary banking transactions
are taking place.

(c) The contents of each bag of coin should be emptied into another
and passed through the scales. The treasurer should see that the index of the
scales is steady before the contents are thrown out.

(d) The treasure should then be secured in separate chests and kept
distinct from other treasure under the joint keys of the Manager or Agent of the
Bank and of the treasurer of the remitting treasury until regularly examined and
brought to account.

(e) Nothing  should  intervene  between  the  treasurer  of  the  remitting
treasury and the Bank’s examining shroffs, so that an uninterrupted view may be
obtained by the former of the examination of the treasure. The treasurer of the
remitting treasury should sit within the railed enclosures along with the Bank’s
examining shroffs.

(f) As soon as the detailed examination of the remittance is completed,
light-weight coin should be weighed against full weight coin and a certificate
of the result granted on the spot to the treasurer of the remitting treasury.

PART  VI

       RULE 374

(g) The  weighment  and  the  detailed  examination  of  a  remittance
should be conducted separately, not simultaneously; the weighment should
be completed before the detailed examination is begun.

(h) If the work of weighment or detailed examination be not finished
within the day, the bags of coin or bundles of notes not finally taken over by
the Bank should be placed in chests under double locks; the key of one of
the locks should be retained by the treasurer of the remitting treasury and
the key of the other by the Bank authorities.

(i) The Bank’s shroffs who begin the weighment and examination of
a remittance should continue at the same duty until they have completed the
examination of the remittance, or such portion of it as has been taken over
for examination, they should not be replaced by others except when that is
unavoidable owing to sickness.

(j) When  the  remittance  is  not  accompanied  by  a  treasurer,  the
Manager or Agent of the Bank should proceed with the examination only after
asking the local Treasury Officer to depute a subordinate to be present at the
examination and see that it is carried out by the Bank with sufficient precautions.
The Treasury Officer should depute for the purpose a subordinate of some
standing. The charges actually incurred in connection with the deputation of
such a subordinate should be debited to the Reserve Bank.

(k) The Treasurer or Treasurers accompanying the remittance should,
before  finally  leaving  the  Bank,  sign  in  a  book  kept  for  the  purpose  a
memorandum of the uncurrent and spurious coins and of any deficiency found
in the remittance.

(l) If a Treasurer accompanying a remittance finds that any of the
above rules is not complied with or that impediments of any kind are placed
upon a free and open scrutiny of the proceedings during the examination by
the Bank’s officers or shroffs, he should immediately report the facts to the
Manager or Agent of the Bank.

       RULES 375-376

C.  RESERVE BANK OF INDIA REMITTANCES

(i)   Introductory

375. Rules 376 to 423 below are designed primarily for the guidance of
Treasury Officers in dealing with the payments into and withdrawals from
treasuries in connection with the facilities afforded by the Reserve Bank to
Government Officers and others for the remittances of moneys from one place
to another. These remittances are arranged for by the issue of Telegraphic
Transfers, Drafts, etc., on the Reserve Bank Account.

376. Remittances between places where the Reserve Bank has its own
offices or is represented by its State Bank of India agencies having full currency
chest  facilities,  will  not  pass  through  the  Government Account. At  places
where the Reserve Bank is not so represented, all treasuries and sub treasuries
in India with currency chest facilities and such other treasuries or sub treasuries
as may be nominated by the Reserve Bank in this behalf, will be regarded as
‘Treasury Agencies’  of  the  Reserve  Bank  for  the  issue  and  payment  of
Telegraphic  Transfers  and  Drafts  drawn  by  or  upon  them.  The  connected
debits and credits in the treasury accounts which will be carried initially against
the balance of the Government owning the treasury or the sub treasury, as the
case may be, will be cleared by the Accountant General by daily adjustments
advised to the Central Account Office of the Reserve Bank in accordance with
such directions as may be given by the Comptroller and Auditor General with
the approval of the President.

NOTE 1—At places where the cash business of the treasury is conducted
by sub offices of the State Bank of India having limited currency
chest  facilities  (i.e.,  Treasury  Pay  Offices)  Reserve  Bank
remittances  will  be  drawn  by  or  upon  the  treasury  or  sub
treasury  at  such  places  acting  as  Treasury Agencies  of  the
Reserve  Bank  and  not  the  Treasury  Pay  Office  of  the  State
Bank, through the cash and clerical work in connection therewith
will be transacted by the latter on the orders of the Treasury or
the Sub Treasury Officer, as the case may be.

The  names  of  treasuries  and  sub  treasuries  which,  for  the
purpose of this rule, are regarded as Treasury Agencies of the
Reserve Bank, will be found in the separate publication ‘List of
Treasuries  and  Sub  Treasuries  in  India’  issued  by  the
Government of India.

       RULES 376-379

NOTE 2—For  the  purpose  of  the  rules  in  this  section,  the  term  ‘Draft’
includes also Reserve Bank dividend payment orders referred
to in Rule 377 below.

377. The various types of remittances between one ‘Treasury Agency’
and another or between treasury agencies and places where the Reserve Bank
is represented, will consist of—

(1) For  Government  Department,  Local  Funds  Scheduled  Banks,
approved Non-Scheduled Banks, Indigenous Bankers, Co-operative Banks
and  Societies  and  for  the  general  public—  (i)    Telegraphic  Transfers,  (ii)
Reserve Bank Drafts.

(2) For the Reserve Bank’s domestic purposes-(i) Security Deposit

Interest Drafts.(ii) Dividend Warrant Payment Orders.

The rates at which and the conditions and limitations under which
Telegraphic Transfers and Drafts on the several accounts can be issued by
Treasury Agencies will be regulated by such general or special instructions
as may be issued by the Reserve Bank with the approval of the President.
NOTE— Drafts at par will be granted within prescribed limits to Government
Officers  and  others  at  and  on  all  offices  and  agencies  (including
Treasury Agencies) of the Reserve Bank for remittances on behalf of
the  Government  and  for  other  quasi-public  purposes  set  forth  in
Appendix  20.  These  remittances  at  par  will  be  granted  only  for
transfers  of  funds  within  the  State.  Extra-State  transfers  will  be
subject to exchange charges at the rates prescribed by the Reserve
Bank.

378. The procedure to be observed by Treasury Officers in respect of
the issue and payment of Telegraphic Transfers and Drafts on the Reserve
Bank account will be governed by the following rules, but the Treasury Officers
shall comply with any general or special instructions that may be issued to
them in this behalf by the Currency Officer.

379. Subject as hereinafter provided, the various forms to be used in
connection with drawings on or by Treasury Agencies will be designed by
the Reserve Bank.

The form of initial accounts to be kept by Treasury Agencies in respect
of  remittances  drawn  and  encashed  by  them  and  the  methods  by  which
accounts of such remittances are to be rendered by them to the Accountant
General, will be governed by such directions as may be given by the Comptroller
and Auditor General with the approval of the President. (See Articles 78 to 85
of the Kerala Account Code, Vol. II.)

PART  VI

       RULES 380-382

(ii)  Telegraphic Transfers, Issues and Encashments

380.    A person applying for a Telegraphic Transfer must pay the amount
of such transfer together with the prescribed charges, including the cost of
telegram, before the Telegraphic Transfer is issued.

The application must be made in the form prescribed by the Reserve
Bank, which may be obtained from the Treasury.The application form duly
filled in will serve as a chalan for the money tendered. The Treasury Officer
shall retain the application for transmission to the Accountant General along
with the daily “Schedule of Reserve Bank of India Remittances Drawn” (Rule
407  below)  and  grant  the  remitter  a  receipt  in  the  form  prescribed  by  the
Reserve Bank for the purpose.

381.

In  issuing  a  Telegraphic  Transfer,  the  following  rules  shall  be

observed by the Treasury Officer:—

(i) The telegram to the office making payment of the transfer should
be sent in Reserve Bank Cypher Code authenticated by the Reserve Bank of
India Treasury Agencies Private Check Signal.

(ii) A post copy of the telegram and an advice in Form R.B.R. 6-C
should be despatched to the paying office at the same time as the telegram is
issued.

382.
be observed:—

In paying a Telegraphic Transfer, the following precautions shall

(i) The person claiming payment should be required to produce the

telegraphic advice from the place where the transfer has been issued.

(ii) If the person to whom the transfer is payable is not known to
him, the Treasury Officer should require identification by a well known and
responsible person who should certify that the payee is known to him.

(iii) The payment of the transfer should be reported at once by a

letter to the issuing officer.

(iv) If the Treasury Officer has any reason, to doubt whether any
person claiming payment is entitled to it, he should telegraph to the issuing
office for confirmation.

(v) If  the  post  copy  of  the  telegram  authorizing  payment  is  not
received within three days of the date on which it should arrive, the Treasury
Officer  should  communicate  with  the  issuing  officer  and  ask  for  his
confirmation of the telegram.

PART  VI

       RULES 382-386

NOTE—A schedule bank applying for payment of the amount of a Telegraphic
Transfer may not produce the telegram received from the remitter,
but, instead, a mere letter from the Agent/Manager of the branch
concerned advising receipt of intimation of the Telegraphic Transfer
and  demanding  payment  should  be  considered  adequate  for  the
purpose of clause (i) of this rule.

383. Remittances will be payable in legal tender currency, i.e., notes
or coins, at the convenience of the officer making payment. In other words,
the payee will have no right to demand payment in any particular form of
currency though in practice, his requirements will be met as far as possible.

384. The  provisions  of  Rule  404  below  apply  mutatis  mutandis  to

payments of Telegraphic Transfers as they apply to payments of Drafts.

(iii)    Drafts,  Drawings  and  Encashments

385. Explanations.—The  person  or  office  that  draws  (i.e.,  issues  or
grants) a Draft is called the drawer, the person or office on which it is drawn
and by which it is payable is caller the drawee, the person or party to whom a
draft is granted is called the remitter and the person or party to whom it is
payable is the payee.

386. All Drafts, unless the contrary intention appears from the form
itself are transferable, the original payee being entitled to transfer his right
by endorsement. This he may do by simply signing his name on the back, in
which case it becomes payable to bearer, or he may write above his signature,
“Pay to C.D.” or “Pay to C.D. or order” in which case C.D. stands in the same
position as the original payee did originally and has the same power of transfer.
The writing by which such a right is transferred is called an endorsement, the
endorsement to “C.D. or order” is a Special endorsement, and the persons to
whom a Draft is successively transferred are endorsees, and the person in
rightful possession of a draft is the holder.

In obtaining drafts for remittance of moneys on Government account,
the  following  instructions  should  be  observed  by  all  officers  of  the
Government:-

(a) Payments  on  accounts  of  inter-departmental  or  inter-
governmental dues:—All such drafts should be crossed if drawn on an office
of the Reserve Bank or any of its agencies other than a treasury agency, with

PART  VI

       RULES 386-388

the words “account payee” between the crossing and, if drawn on a treasury
agency,  the  drafts  should  be  superscribed  with  the  words  “account
Government-not payable in cash” without any crossing.

(b) When  the  amounts  of  the  drafts  are  required  by  officers  of
the Government to enable them to make disbursements in cash, on behalf
of Government, e.g., pay and allowances of non-gazetted staff, contingent
expenditure,  permanent  advance,  etc.—Drafts,  the  amounts  of  which  are
payable to officers of the Government to enable them to make disbursement
of  pay  and  allowances  of  non-gazetted  staff,  contingent  expenditure,  etc.,
on  behalf  of  Government,  shall  not  be  crossed  but  shall  bear  the
superscription  “not  transferable”  and  shall  be  issued  in  favour  of  the
Government officer concerned, by designation, the word “only” being added
after  the  designation  of  the  payee  officer  on  the  draft.  For  this  purpose,
every Government Officer, when applying for a Draft, must add the word
“only” after the name of the payee in the application for the draft, so that the
Issuing Officer may prepare the draft accordingly. It shall not, however, be
permissible for any Government Officer himself to add the word “only” after
the name of the payee of the Draft in any case in which the Issuing Officer, for
any reason, fails to add the word “themselves”.

(c) Payments  of  personal  claims  of  an  individual  (whether  a
Government servant or not), a firm or a company, a statutory body, etc.—
All drafts in payment of such claims shall be issued invariably with the addition
of the words “or order” after the name of the payee on the Draft. Such drafts,

than  a

Form of Drafts

387. Drafts shall be issued in special forms to be obtained from the

Currency Officer under Rule 420 below.

388.

Immediately on receipt of a parcel of forms of Drafts, they shall be
carefully examined by the Treasury Officer and a proper acknowledgment
sent to the Currency Officer. The acknowledgment shall certify that the forms
have been counted and found correct.

PART  VI

       RULES 389-390

389. The  forms  of  Drafts  and  of  advices  (Rule  393  below)  shall  be
placed  in  store  under  the  key  of  the  Treasury  Officer  who  should  each
morning  issue  for  book  or  books  containing  Draft  Forms  and  the Advice
Forms, for the day’s use. He must be careful not to issue a book of a later
serial number before an earlier, and therefore should see that the store is so
arranged  as  to  prevent  mistakes.  Every  evening  the  unused  forms  will  be
returned to him, and he should see that this series is unbroken, that no form
is kept back unissued unless it be spoilt and that the number of Draft Forms
expended in the day agrees with the total number listed in the “Schedule of
the Reserve Bank of India Remittance Drawn” for the day. (Rule 407 below)

Officers signing drafts shall destroy spoilt Draft Forms after noting in
the remarks column of the Issue-cum—Drawing Schedule Register (Form T.A.
18 or 18A in the Kerala Account Code, Vol. II) under their full signature the
printed numbers of the forms destroyed and certifying that the forms have
been cancelled and destroyed.

Issue of Drafts

390. A person requiring a Draft shall tender with the money a formal
application in prescribed form, which may be obtained from the treasury. The
application form duly filled in will serve as a chalan for the money tendered.
The application shall be retained by the Treasury Officer for transmission to
the Accountant General along with the daily “Schedule of Reserve Bank of
India Remittances Drawn”. (Rule 407 below)

NOTE 1—A person applying for a Draft on behalf of the Government or a Local
Fund should certify on the application that the Draft is wanted for
bona fide public purposes and describe the object of the remittance.
If the Treasury Officer doubts whether the object is really public,
he should state his doubt to the applicant or take the orders of the
Collector. Questionable grants should be reported to the Currency
Officer with a view to the issue of instructions for future guidance.

NOTE 2—When the purchaser of the Draft demands a receipt for the amount
of  the  Draft  and  the  exchange  charges  thereon,  the  Treasury
Officer may grant the purchaser a receipt in the form prescribed
by the Reserve Bank for the purpose.

PART  VI

       RULES 391-393

391. Drafts shall be prepared and signed from time to time as they are
applied for, immediately on the receipt of cash or its equivalent; the business
of  signing  them  must  not  be  postponed  till  the  close  of  office,  and  on  no
account may the office be closed till all Drafts applied for have been issued.
Each must be signed legibly with the full signature of the Treasury Officer.

392. At the time of signature of a Draft, the Register (Form T.A. 18A in
the Kerala Account Code, Volume II), together with the application for the
Draft, the advice (Rule 393 below) and the book of forms shall be laid together
before the Treasury Officer. The Treasury Officer shall initial each entry in the
Advice and the corresponding entry in the register at the same time as he
signs the Drafts after he has satisfied himself that-

(i)

the several documents agree,

(ii)
(iii)

(iv)

the authority for issue is sufficient,
the date and office of issue and the name of the payee are legibly
and distinctly entered in the body of the Draft,
in addition to the amount being entered in figures, the amount
of whole rupees is entered as second time in words and fractions
of a rupee in words or figures, that words are written continuously
without lifting the pen and that when the amount consists of
rupees only and does not contain fractions of a rupee, the words
end with the word “only”, and

(v) a sum a little in excess of that for which the draft is granted is

entered in words across the Draft at right angles to the type.

NOTE 1—“Under thirty rupees” will mean that the Draft is for a sum not less
than  `. 20 but less than  ` 30, and similarly, “under eight hundred
rupees” will mean that it is for less than  ` 800, but not less than
`. 700.

NOTE 2—The cross entry is not necessary if the amount in words is typed
perforated by a special cheque writing machine.
Advice of Remittances drawn

393. An advice of all drawings effected on a particular treasury or the
Bank on any particular date shall be sent to the treasury or the office drawn upon
in the special form prescribed by the Reserve Bank. The Advices shall be completed,
signed and despatched by the Treasury Officer before the treasury closes on the
day of issue.

Advices of drafts drawn on the Bank shall be sent direct to the

Manager or Agent as the case may be, of the Bank.

294

PART  VI

       RULES 393-396

NOTE—Whenever  two  or  more  sheets  are  used  for  advising  the  issue  of
Drafts, each such sheet should be signed by the Treasury Officer.

394.

If alterations be made in a Draft prior to issue, the corrections
shall be noted in the Advice and each alteration, both in Draft and Advice,
shall  be  authenticated  by  the  drawer’s  full  signature  in  order  to  prevent
hesitation, on the part of the drawee. If the drawer should enter the amount
so  carelessly  as  to  enable  a  stranger  to  alter  it  and  fraudulently  to  obtain
payment of a larger amount, the drawer, and not the drawee, must bear the
loss.  But  the  Treasury  Officer  drawn  on  must  remember  and  apply  the
numerous defensive checks provided for him by these rules.

Regularity  of  Signature

395. Variation in the signature of the drawer often entails much trouble
on the paying office, and the drawer will be held responsible for inconvenience
or delay which may be caused to individuals in consequence of change in, or
illegibility of, his signature, or other serious irregularity on the face of the
draft, as the drawee would be justified in suspending payment in cases of
doubt arising from such cases. An officer in charge of a treasury shall sign his
name in English, or have it written in English characters below the signature in
any Indian script.

396. When any change of Treasury Officer occurs, a specimen of the
signature of the relieving officer shall be forwarded by the outgoing officer to
all officers usually drawn on.  The following form will be convenient

“ The undersigned writes to notify  to ……………………………… that
he  has  on  this  day  been  relieved  of  the  executive  charge  of  the
treasury at ………………………. by …………………………… a specimen of
whose signature is annexed. …………...……

.....................................
                                                                                      Relieved Officer
.....................................

 Relieving Officer.”

NOTE 1—If it should be necessary for a Treasury Officer to draw on a treasury
or an office not usually drawn upon, to which a specimen of his
signature has not been sent under the provisions of this rule, he

PART  VI

       RULES 396-398

should, at the time of issue of a draft, also forward a specimen of
his signature under a special forwarding letter duly stamped with
the seal of the treasury, which should be posted on the same day
in a separate cover and not in the cover containing the Advice.

NOTE 2—In the case of an officer who signs in any Indian script, his name
should  also  be  written  in  English  characters  in  the  notice,  as
well as after his signature.

NOTE 3—When  an  officer  who  was  formerly  in  charge  of  a  treasury
resumes charge of it after a lapse of time, his signature need not
again be circulated among treasury and other offices.

Encashment  of  Drafts

397. The Advices  received  from  the  issuing  treasuries  of  the  Bank
shall be opened in the presence of the Treasury Officer, and each dated and
initialled by him after he has satisfied himself of its genuineness by examining
the signature of the drawer and, if necessary, the post mark. They shall then
be sorted and arranged accordingly to the offices from which they are received
and pasted chronologically in guard files in such a way that advices received
from each drawing office may be kept together. These files shall be kept under
lock and key.

NOTE        1—The  Treasury  Officers  should  particularly  guard  against  the
possibility of the fraud of altering after signature the amount
shown  in  the Advice,  by  a  comparison  of  the  total  amount
reported in words in the heading with the real total of the figured
amounts of an Advice. Any alteration of any entry, whether of
names  of  figures,  in  an Advice  requires  the  drawer’s  full
signature, so that it is scarcely possible that any fraud should
be attempted by altering the Advice before he has signed it,
since at the time of signing he would notice any uncertified
correction.

NOTE    2—All covers containing “Advices of remittances sold” received
from the issuing treasuries or the Bank shall be superscribed
with the words “Remittance Advice”.

398. The Advices  arranged  in  the  manner  prescribed  in  the  last
preceding rule will facilitate the examination and identification of Drafts, etc.,

       RULES 398-399

presented for payment. The entries made in an Advice should be such as to
place sufficient obstacle to the encashment of Drafts forged or fraudulently
altered, and their sequence should effectually bar the use, a second time, of a
particular serial number, and suggest suspicion even of the Advice where a
high number follows a low one.

Necessary  notes  of  references  touching  irregularities  of  cancellation,
issue of certificates of non-payment, Advices of seconds or thirds, and of any
other points of importance shall be made on the Advice.

399.

(a)    On  a  Draft  being  presented  for  encashment,  the  Treasury
Officer shall compare it with the Advice, and satisfy himself carefully that it is
in order and that it is receipted on the back by a person able to give a legal
quittance. It must be borne in mind that in the case of a Draft on Government
account the liability to the payee named in the Draft can only be discharged
by payment to—

(1)

the payee or his lawful agent on identification, or

(2) The  payee’s  banker  who  should  certify  that  the  amount  has

been placed to the payee’s credit, or

(3) a person holding a letter of authority from the payee, whose
signature  must  be  known  to  the  Treasury  Officer  and  if  the
letter  directs  to  the  Treasury  Officer  to  pay  the  money  to  a
certain  named  person,  that  person  must  be  identified  to  the
Treasury  Officer  before  payment  can  be  made.  The  only
endorsement on such a Draft should be payee’s receipt or that
of his lawful agent.

(b) In all other cases where payment is not made on an endorsement in
favour of a recognized bank, the Treasury Officer shall not only satisfy himself of
the genuineness of the claimant’s signature to the receipt on the back of a Draft
but, if the claimant himself is not in attendance, he must assure himself that the
presenter of the Draft is the agent or messenger of the legal holder, duly authorized
to receive the payment. If the presenter is unknown to the treasury officials, or, if
known, should there be reasonable grounds for questioning his being in lawful
possession of the Draft, the Treasury Officer shall demand a letter from the legal
holder, authorizing the presenter to receive payment on his behalf. Similarly, in
cases where payment is made on an endorsement to a recognized bank, the Treasury
Officer must assure himself that the presenter of the Draft is the authorized agent
or messenger of the Bank.

       RULES 399-403

NOTE    1— The term “recognized bank” referred to in this Rule includes a
scheduled bank under the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, or
a bank or firm mentioned in Appendix 9.

NOTE      2— The letter of authority for receiving payment at the treasury

referred to in this rule in not liable to stamp duty.

400. Drafts  payable  at  the  District Treasury  cannot  be  endorsed  for
payment at a Sub Treasury. But if the money payable on a Draft is required at
a Sub Treasury and the remittance cannot be effected in accordance with the
procedure laid down in Rule 416 below, a cash order may be issued to the
payee for presentation at the Sub Treasury. In such a case the payee must
receipt the Draft as “Received payment by a cash order on …………………
Sub Treasury”, and the Treasury Officer at the District Treasury shall finally
deal with the Draft and take the same precautions regarding the delivery of the
cash order as are prescribed in Rule 401 below for payment in cash.

401. Before issuing pay orders on a Draft the Treasury Officer shall
satisfy  himself  that  the  Draft  has  been  advised;  that  it  corresponds  in  all
particulars with the Advice; that it bears the genuine signature of the drawer;
that it has not been tampered with; and that it is not a cancelled or lapsed Draft
or one of which a duplicate has been paid. A Draft may be paid—

(i) without  Advice,  if  there  is  no  reason  whatsoever  to  doubt  its
genuineness, and if sufficient security is offered. In the case of well known
and reliable holders, this security may be dispensed with at the discretion of
the Treasury Officer. The Treasury Officer shall in all such cases apply for the
necessary Advice without delay.

(ii) even though differing from the Advice, at the discretion of the
Treasury Officer, provided there is no suspicion of fraudulent alteration, nor
any possible doubt of the genuineness of the Draft. Special caution shall be
exercised before paying on a Draft an amount larger than that named in the
Advice.

402. As each Draft or Telegraphic Transfer drawn by the Treasury is
paid, it must be stamped “paid”, the date of payment being at the same time
noted in the Advice under the initials of the Treasury Officer.

403. Doubtful drawings.—In case of erasure, alteration or other serious
cause for suspicion, the Treasury Officer shall, before payment, refer to the
drawer, the post office, or the Currency Officer, as the case may require. Any

       RULES 403-404

material alteration of a Draft, after it has been drawn or endorsed effecting the
date, sum, or time or place of payment, will invalidate it; but the mere correction
of a mistake, such as by inserting the words “or order” in the endorsement of
a Draft will have no such effect.

404. Form of receipt.—For the sufficiency of the receipt, it is necessary
to see that it is not for a part only of the Draft, and that it is given by the legal
holder. On no account may a Draft be paid by instalment; receipt for the full
amount must be given on the reverse, and the full amount must be paid—

(a) if the legal holder be dead, payment can be made only to his legal
representative; a Draft for less than ` 100 may, however, be paid without a
certificate of administration.

(b) if  the  receipt  be  signed  by  an  agent  or  attorney,  note  of  the
existence, and of the record in the treasury, of the power of attorney, should
be made on the Draft.

(c) if more than one person be named in a Draft, all must join in order

to give a valid endorsement or receipt.

(d)   Draft payable to A.B. cannot be cashed on the receipt of his partner
C.D. without production of a formal power of attorney; a bill payable to A.B. and
Co. can be paid on the receipt as A.B. and Co. of any member of the firm.

(e)   Drafts payable to an incorporated company of any other corporate
body may be paid on the receipt of the official authorized, generally or specially,
by it regulations or by power of attorney to receive moneys payable to such
company or body.

In the case of Draft payable to an unincorporated body, payment may
be  made  to  a  person  holding  authority  to  receive  moneys  payable  to  such
body, but the Treasury Officer shall first satisfy himself that the authority has
been duly conferred.

(f)  A government officer when he sends a Draft to a treasury not for
cash payment, but for credit of its amount in the treasury accounts, must,
before he signs the receipt, add to the words “Received payment” the further
words  “by  transfer  credit  to……….”.  Omission  to  do  this  facilitates
fraudulent appropriation of the money.

       RULES 405-409

 (iv)  Record of Drawings and Encashments

405. A record of Telegraphic Transfers and Drafts drawn by the treasury
will  be  kept  in  a  register  (Form  T.A.  18  or  18A)  in  accordance  with  the
directions contained in this behalf in the Kerala Account Code, Volume II.

406. As each Draft or Telegraphic Transfer is paid, entry must be made
in the Register of Reserve Bank of India Remittances Encashed (Form T.A.
19 in the Kerala Account Code, Volume II).

407. At  the  close  of  each  day,  separate  schedules  for  drawings  and
encashments during the day will be prepared in special forms prescribed by
the Reserve Bank for submission to the Accountant General in accordance
with the directions contained in the Kerala Account Code, Volume II. The
application forms for remittances drawn and also the receipted Drafts and the
payees’ receipts in respect of Telegraphic transfers encashed shall accompany
the schedules mentioned above.

408. The following are the cross-checks which the Treasury Officer
shall, each evening, apply to the several documents connected with remittances
drawn and encashed. The registers of remittances drawn and encashed and
the connected schedules check one another directly; the total of each schedule
must agree with total receipts or total payments for the day as booked under
the head “Reserve Bank of India Remittances” in the cash book, after allowing
for receipts and payments, if any Sub Treasuries which will be entered under
a separate sub head. The total of the several Advices for the day must also
agree with the total in the column “Amount” in the schedule of drawings, and
this agreement shall be, at times, checked by the Treasury Officer himself.

409. Where  the  name  of  the  payee  and/or  endorsee  appears  on  the
instrument  in  English  and  the  signature  is  made  in  English,  the  Treasury
Officer  should,  in  addition  to  the  precautions  prescribed  in  the  Rules  for
making payment to the proper person on identification, see that the signature
tallies letter for letter with the name as spelt on the instrument. Where the
name  of  the  payee  or  endorsee  is  spelt  incorrectly,  the  spelling  of  the
endorsement  must  correspond  with  that  of  the  mis-spelt  name,  but  if  the
payee wishes, he may add his correct name in brackets.

(v)  Other Rules

410.

Issue of duplicates.—When satisfactory evidence has been given
that a draft has been either lost or destroyed, and application is made within a

reasonable  period  after  issue  but  before  it  has  lapsed  (Rule  419  below)  a

duplicate may, without reference to the Currency Officer, be granted to the

party who obtained the original, or to the payee, or to the legal representative

of either but to no other person. If the draft could not have been presented for

payment within three months, it will be necessary for the applicant to produce

a certificate of non-payment from the drawee; but the issue of this certificate

will be no bar to the payment of the lost Draft, if presented before duplicate is

paid.

In the event of the loss of both original and duplicate, a triplicate may be

issued  on  the  same  terms  as  the  duplicate,  the  nonpayment  of  the  others

being certified. Neither duplicate nor triplicate can be issued without reference

to the Currency Officer, if the Draft has lapsed (Rule 419 below). Issue of

duplicate or triplicate shall be promptly advised to the drawee, in order that

proper note may be made on the advice originally received.

411. The duplicate and triplicate shall be drawn in exactly the same

terms as the original instrument with the same date, the same number, the

same amount, and the name of the same payee, so that, if a lost Draft has been

endorsed, the endorsee must apply for a duplicate through the original payee.

It will be issued under the signature of the officer in charge of the treasury at

the time, although he be not the person who signed the original Draft.

NOTE   1—Where the remitter is a department of the Government or a Local

Fund, the issue of a duplicate against an unstamped Letter of
Undertaking as given below, will be permissible.

Dear Sir,

In co.nsideration of your agreeing to issue a duplicate of Reserve Bank
of India draft bearing No………….and dated ……………….for  `……………
(Rupees …………………..) which has been lost, I hereby undertake that, in
the event of payment being obtained from the Reserve Bank on the original
draft or of the Bank incurring any expense and/or loss by reason of the issue
of the duplicate, I shall reimburse the Reserve Bank to the extent of the amount
paid on the original draft and any expense and/or loss incurred as aforesaid.

Yours faithfully,

NOTE   2—When it is necessary to issue duplicates, the word “duplicate”
should be prominently written in red ink on the face of ordinary
draft forms and the relative advice forms. The duplicate should
be  issued  only  after  the  issuing  officer  has  satisfied  himself
that the original has not been paid.

412. No duplicate or triplicate older than six months shall be paid without

previous reference to the Currency Officer.

413. Cancellation and Refund.—No Draft can be cancelled without
surrender of the whole set. Thus, if a duplicate or a triplicate has been issued
the Draft can be cancelled only if the original together with the duplicate (and
the triplicate if issued) be surrendered. Consequently, no refund can be made
on a lost Draft; a duplicate must be obtained and payment taken at the treasury
or office drawn on.

PART  VI

  RULES  414-417

414. All  parts  being  surrendered,  a  Draft  may  be  cancelled  and  its
amount refunded at the discretion of the Treasury Officer, on the application
and receipt of the remitter in the case of a Draft on Government account and of
the payee in the case of other Drafts. If, in the latter case, the receipt of the
payee cannot be obtained, the remitter’s application for cancellation, with
explanation of the reasons for his request, and of the difficulty in the way of
obtaining the payee’s signature, shall be submitted for orders of the Currency
Officer. Although no difficulty should be made about cancellation of Drafts
on Government account, it must be clearly understood that other classes of
Drafts can be cancelled only as an indulgence, and for sufficient cause shown.
No exchange which has been levied can be refunded.

NOTE— If alteration of the name only of the payee is required by remitter, it
will suffice for the drawer to alter the name in the Draft under his full
signature and send advice to the drawee.

415. When  a  Draft  is  cancelled,  the  fact  of  cancellation  shall  be
conspicuously noted across the face of the Draft; at the same time an intimation
shall be sent to the office drawn on, in order that the fact may be recorded in
the advice originally received and necessary precautions taken against the
payment of the cancelled Draft. The cancelled Drafts shall be duly receipted
by the remitter or the payee, as the case may be.

NOTE— The amount refunded will be entered in the “Register of Reserve
Bank of India Remittances Encashed” and also in the proper columns
of  the  schedule  of  such  encashments  for  the  day  on  which  the
cancellation takes place, in accordance with the directions contained
in this behalf in the Kerala Account Code, Volume II.

416. A Treasury Officer may issue a Draft in exchange for one drawn
on him only if the holder has been removed to the neighbourhood of another
treasury or of an office or agency of the Bank.

NOTE— A Draft is said to be exchanged when the holder being unable to
appear and take payment in cash, applies for a new one endorsing
the original “Received payment by Draft on …………….”.

If  he can appear and take payment in cash, his obtaining a new Draft
with the cash paid on the old one is a matter to be disposed of under
ordinary rules.

417. When a Draft is exchanged for another, the original Draft will be
treated  and  entered  as  a  Draft  presented  for  encashment  and  the  amount
again credited as received for the issue of a new Draft.

PART  VI

  RULES  418-423

418. Unpaid Drafts.—Drafts which are outstanding for more than six
months can be paid only after obtaining the necessary confirmation from the
drawing office.

419. Lapse of Drafts.—Drafts which are not paid before the end of the
third  account  year  after  that  in  which  they  are  issued,  shall  be  treated  as
lapsed and shall be so marked in the Advice. Should any one apply for payment
of a lapsed Draft, he should be directed to address the Currency Officer for
orders.

420. Supply of forms.—Forms of Drafts and all other forms prescribed
by the Reserve Bank for use in connection with the remittances dealt with in
this section will be supplied to the Treasury Officer by the Currency Officer
under whose jurisdiction the treasury is situated. Indents for such supplies
will be in Form T.R. 94 or in such other forms as the Reserve Bank may prescribe
and will ordinarily be for twelve months’ supply.

421. Special  Rules  for  remittances  of  policemen.—In  the  case  of
policemen’s remittances, the Superintendent of Police concerned shall forward
the  Drafts  to  the  payees  direct.  There  is  no  objection,  if  such  a  course  is
preferred, or is required by departmental regulations, to his sending the Draft
to the Superintendent of Police of the district in which the payee resides, who
will deliver it to the payee after satisfying himself as to his identity. Descriptive
rolls of the payees duly filled in and signed shall, at the same time, be sent to
the Treasury Officers concerned.

422. The Drafts are payable to the parties described in the roll. In cases
of doubtful identity, payment may be made on security at the discretion of the
Treasury Officer.

423. These drafts, if not, presented for payment at the expiration of six
months from the date of issue, shall be considered as cancelled and if they are
presented  after  that  period,  payments  shall  be  refused. A  draft  which  has
become uncurrent may be returned by the payee to the drawer for the issue of
a fresh draft or for the refund of the amount, as may be required.

Should such a draft, whether original or duplicate, be lost in transit, the
Superintendent of Police will report the loss to the Currency Officer, who will
decide  the  case  specially  on  its  merits,  sanctioning  refund  to  the  person
indicated if it appears right. When the draft is six months old and therefore
void, there need be no hesitation in permitting refund on production of a non-
payment certificate from the treasury or office on which it was drawn.

NOTE— These drafts may also be cancelled as provided for in Rule 414 above.

PART   VII

RESPONSIBILITY FOR MONEYS WITHDRAWN

SECTION   I
Responsibility of Treasury Officer in recovering amounts
disallowed by the Accountant-General

424. When  the  Accountant  General  disallows  a  payment  as
unauthorized,  the  Treasury  Officer  should  promptly  recover  the  amount
disallowed, without regard to any representation or protest and if the item is a
recurring one, should also refuse to make similar payments in future until the
Accountant General authorize him to do so. The Treasury Officer should not
enter into any correspondence regarding any such recovery.

If  a  Treasury  Officer  receives  an  order  to  make  a  recovery  from  a
government servant who has been transferred to another district, he should
immediately forward it to the Treasury Officer of that other district.

NOTE— A  recovery  should,  when  necessary,  be  made  in  instalments  as

prescribed in Article 71 of the Kerala Financial Code.

425.

(a)     The Treasury Officer should invariably recover from the next
contingent  bill  of  the  office  concerned  any  amount  which  the Accountant
General orders him to recover on account of contingencies.

 (b)     The Treasury Officer should ordinarily recover from the next
pay  bill  of  the  government  servant  concerned  any  amount  which  the
Accountant General orders him to recover on account of pay and similarly
from the next travelling allowance bill any recovery ordered on account of
travelling allowance. When, however, a recovery has to be made on account
of  travelling  allowance  and  the  government  servant  concerned  does  not
present a travelling allowance bill within a month he should be requested to
refund the amount at once in cash and if he fails to do so, it should be recovered
from his next pay bill.

(c)      If a recovery has to be made but no bill from which it can be
made is likely to be submitted in the near future and the government servant
who has to make good the amount does not refund it promptly in cash when
requested to do so, the Treasury Officer should report the circumstances to
Accountant General and ask for his orders.

  RULES  425-427

(d) A recovery should be shown distinctly at the foot of the bill
(not on a sub-voucher) and the number and the date of the objection statement

or other authority should be distinctly quoted.

426. Objections and orders which arise out of the examination by the

Accountant  General  of  the  treasury  accounts  are  communicated  to  the

Treasury  Officer  by  letters,  audit  memoranda,  or  periodical  objection

statements.  To  these,  the  earliest  attention  should  be  given  and  it  is  most

important that these objection statements should be returned punctually within

a fortnight of receipt and also that the replies in them should be such as will

enable the Accountant General to adjust the items under objection without

further correspondence. When it is necessary to communicate objections to

other officers as in the case of officers subordinate to the Collector, it should

be done immediately on receipt of the objection statements and early replies

should be asked for. If these are not received in time for the return of the

objection statement to the Accountant General, the fact should be noted in

the  reply  column  of  the  statement  and  the  receipt  of  the  reply  and  its

transmission to the Accountant General should be carefully watched. A copy

of the objection statement should be kept in the treasury.

427. Register of Recoveries.—Every treasury should maintain a register

of  recoveries,  in  which  separate  pages  should  be  set  apart,  as  may  be

convenient, for each government servant or department entitled to draw bills,

etc., on the treasury. As soon as any order to make a recovery is received,

whether through an objection statement or a separate slip, an entry should be

made in the register. Before any bill is passed for payment, the register should

be consulted to see whether any recovery has to be made. When any amount

is recovered, it should be duly noted in the register along with the number and
date of the voucher.

SECTION   II

General rules applicable to all Drawing Officers

(a)    RESPONSIBILITY  IN  CLEARING AUDIT  OBJECTIONS

428. Every government servant must attend promptly to all objections
and orders communicated to him by the Accountant General in the manner
prescribed in Article 69 to 74 of the Kerala Financial Code.

(b)    GENERAL  RULES  REGARDING  THE  FORM  OF  VOUCHERS

FOR DISBURSEMENTS MADE, ETC.

429. A  government  servant  is  responsible  for  the  safe  custody  of
moneys received by him from the treasury for expenditure on behalf of the
Government and shall maintain the prescribed accounts for watching the correct
disposal of the money (e.g., by disbursement of pay, allowances, etc., among
the staff) and for checking the cash balance in the office.

(a)

430.

Subject to the provisions of clause (b) below a government
servant shall obtain, for every disbursement which he makes on behalf of the
Government including every repayment of moneys which have been deposited
with the Government, a voucher setting forth full and clear particulars of the
claim, using as far as possible the particular form, if any, prescribed for the
purpose and shall obtain at the time of making payment, either on the voucher
or on a separate paper to be attached to it, an acknowledgment of the payment
signed by the payee by hand and in ink. In doing so, he shall observe carefully
the directions in Rule 163 in regard to the preparation of vouchers and the
stamping of receipts. When possible, he shall require the payee to note the
actual date of payment in his acknowledgment. When it is not possible for the
payee  to  note  the  actual  date  of  payment  either  because  he  is  illiterate  or
because he is required to present a signed receipt before payment is made, the
disbursing officer shall enter the actual date of payment on the relevant voucher
with his initials either separately for each payment or for groups of payments
as may be found convenient.

NOTE— As adjustment bills for ‘Nil’ amounts involve no payment, it is not
necessary to insist upon any acknowledgment of payment in respect
of such bills.

PART  VII

          RULE 430

If  a  payee is not able to write, his signature on the acknowledgment
shall  be  taken  in  the  form  of  his  mark  or  preferably  his  thumb
impression, attested invariably by some known person [See  Rule
163 (g) of Part V].

If a payee signs his acknowledgment in a language other than English,
he shall be required to write also the amount acknowledged in words
in  that  language  in  his  own  handwriting.  His  acknowledgment,
including the amount acknowledged and any remark made by him,
shall  be  translated  into  English  and  his  signature  shall  be
transliterated in Roman characters. If a payee cannot sign his name
in script known to the disbursing officer or a member of his staff or if
he can sign in a script known to one of them but cannot write the
amount acknowledged in words in it, the procedure applicable when
a payee is not able to write shall be followed.

A cash memorandum shall not be treated as a proper voucher (or a
valid receipt), unless it contains a specific signed acknowledgment
of the receipt of the moneys by the signatory from the government
servant concerned, and is duly stamped* with a revenue stamp as
required by section 3 of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 (Central Act 2 of
1899) read with article 53 of schedule I thereof if the amount paid
exceeds ` 20.

Exception  1—A special procedure is prescribed for obtaining the payee’s
acknowledgments of payments on account of the pay and
allowances of government servants (See Rule 432 below).

Exception  2—The  facsimile  signature  of  the  executive  authority  or  a
municipality may be accepted as the payee’s signature on
an acknowledgment of the payment of a municipal tax on
a  government  building.

(b) If, in very exceptional circumstances, it is quite impossible to
furnish a proper voucher with the payee’s acknowledgment in support of a
payment, a certificate of payment showing the particulars of the claim signed
by the disbursing officer and endorsed by his immediate superiors shall be
placed on record.

(c) If a disbursing officer anticipates any difficulty in obtaining an
acknowledgment in the proper form from a person to whom any moneys are

due, he shall decline to deliver the cheque or cash to him or to make a remittance
to him, as the case may be, until he receives a proper acknowledgment of the
payment with all the necessary particulars.

Whenever a payment is made by remittance, a note of the date and mode
of remittance shall be made on the bill or voucher at the time of remittance.
When a remittance is made by postal money order, its purpose shall be briefly
stated in the acknowledgment portion of the money order form in continuation
of  the  entry  “Received  the  sum  specified  above  on  ………………”,  and
sufficient space shall be left below the manuscript addition for the signature
or thumb impression of the payee.

Whenever a disbursing officer of the Public Works or Forest Department
tenders money orders to the Post Office for issue with a cheque in lieu of cash,
he shall demand an individual receipt for each such money order.

(d) When an article is obtained by value payable post, the value
payable cover, together with the invoice or bill showing full details of the
items paid for, shall be treated as a voucher, and the disbursing officer shall
note on the cover that the payment was made through the Post Office and
includes the postal commission.

(e) A  disbursing  officer  may  retain  a  certified  copy  marked
‘Duplicate’ of a receipted voucher, when this is necessary in order to complete
the record in his office, but the payee shall not be required to sign any such
copy or to give a duplicate acknowledgment of the payment.

NOTE— Whenever  copies  of  invoice  are  required  to  be  furnished  by  the
suppliers such number should be restricted to the minimum and the
number required should be indicated in the supply order. The copy
should be distinctly marked as ‘Duplicate’; ‘Triplicate’ etc. (See also
Note 6 of the Form of the Supply Order in Appendix XIII of the Stores
Purchase Manual specifying the number as triplicate).

431. No voucher shall be treated as a valid voucher unless it bears a
distinct pay order, specifying the amount payable both in words and in figures
separately  and  signed  and  dated  by  hand  and  in  ink  by  the  responsible
disbursing officer. Cashiers and other government servants who are authorized
to make payments on passed voucher shall not make any payment on a voucher
unless it bears pay order satisfying the requirements. The fact of payment
with date, the manner in which payment is made (whether by cash or cheque)
and  the  details  of  the  bill  in  which  the  amount  was  drawn  should  also  be
recorded on the voucher and attested by the dated signature of the disbursing
officer.

    RULE  431

NOTE 1—The pay order on the voucher shall be in the following form, viz.,

“Pay    `....................(Rupees……………..)  to  (name  of

payee)………………………………by cash/cheque……………..

Signature,

Station…………......………
Date…………………….

Name and Designation  of  the

The pay order and the details of payment may be recorded on the reverse
of the payee’s receipt, preferably by means of rubber stamps. But the signature
and dates should invariably be by hand and in ink.

NOTE     2— The pay order should always be on the invoice marked ‘original’.
When the ‘original’ is lost the pass order should not be recorded
in the copies marked ‘duplicate’ etc., instead an authenticated
true copy should be obtained and passed. In the ‘duplicate’ or
‘triplicate’ copies of the invoices a certificate of the payment
should, however, be recorded as below:—

“Certified that the original of the invoice/bill has been passed and
paid-Vide item No…………in……………………(contingent or other register).”

      RULE  432

(c)      DISBURSEMENT  OF  PAY AND ALLOWANCES  OF
GOVERNMENT  SERVANTS

(a)

432.

The head of an office is personally responsible for all moneys
drawn as pay, leave salary, allowances, etc., on an establishment bill signed
by him or on his behalf until he has paid them to the persons who are entitled
to receive them and has obtained their dated acknowledgments, duly stamped
when  necessary.  These  acknowledgments  shall  be  taken  as  a  rule  on  the
office copy of the bill. When the head of the office concerned considers that
an establishment is so large or scattered that the payee’s acknowledgments
cannot, without undue inconvenience, be obtained on the office copy of the
bill, he shall maintain a separate acquittance roll in Form T.R. 95 and obtain the
payees’ acknowledgments in it.

The leave salary of a non-gazetted government servant who is on leave
in India shall be drawn in the district in which he was last on duty and he must
make his own arrangements for having it remitted to him, when necessary. As
an exception to the procedure prescribed in the preceding paragraph, when a
government servant is on casual leave or other leave, any moneys due to him
may be remitted by postal money order at his expense, if he has made a written
request for this to be done, in that case, the receipt given by the Post Office
and the payees’ receipt shall be attached to the office copy of the bill or to the
acquittance roll, as the case may be. Alternatively, a government servant who
is on casual or other leave may make a written request that any money due to
him be paid to a specified government servant belonging to the same office;
payment shall then be made accordingly, provided that the Government servant
nominated produces an acknowledgment signed by the absentee (and stamped
when the amount exceeds  ` 20) and that the disbursing officer is satisfied that
the absentee’s written request and acknowledgment of the payment may be
accepted. *The government servant who receives the moneys shall sign on
the back of the absentee’s acknowledgment in token of his having received
the moneys on the absentee’s behalf. The acknowledgment shall be attached
to the office copy of the bill or to the acquittance roll, as the case may be, and
the remark “Separate receipt attached” shall be entered in the appropriate
place in the office copy of the bill or in the receipt column of the roll. Any such
payment is made entirely at the risk of the government servant to whom the
amount  is  due,  and  no  claim  shall  lie  against  the  Government  under  any
circumstances on account of any loss which he may suffer in connection with
it.

  RULE  432

**For  the  disbursement  of  the  pay  and  allowances  etc.  due  to  non-
gazetted Government Servants on tour or on camp or working at out of the
way places other than the headquarters of the drawing officer, any one of the
following methods may be adopted at the written request of such Government
Servants, namely:-

(i)    remittance  to  the  camp  by  postal  money  order  at  the  cost  of  the

Government;

(ii)   remittance to the camp by a Reserve Bank of India draft (to be sent by
registered  post)  provided  the  Government  Servant  gives  an
acknowledgment signed by him (and duly stamped when necessary)
along with the request to make such remittance to camp; and

(iii)  payment to another employee of the same office as specified in the
request  provided  that  the  employee  produces  an  acknowledgment
signed by the absentee (and stamped when necessary).

NOTE—In case of remittances made by draft under the method (ii) above an
acknowledgment of the draft should be obtained from the payee and
filed in serial order.

If a government servant who is entitled to receive any moneys drawn
from the treasury on his behalf fails to claim payment in person or in accordance
with preceding paragraph before the end of the month in which they are so
drawn the moneys drawn for him shall ordinarily be refunded by short drawal
in the next bill, and drawn afresh when he claims them, if the rules regarding
arrear claims permit it. When the drawing officer considers that the earlier
refunding of any such moneys would cause undue inconvenience, he may
retain them for any period not exceeding three months, but he will continue to
be  held  personally  responsible  for  them  and  must  make  satisfactory
arrangements for keeping them safely. Undisbursed pay, allowances and leave
salary shall not, under any circumstances, be placed in deposit.
NOTE—Notwithstanding anything contained in this rule, Government may,
in special circumstances authorize payment of such part of the claim
of a government servant, who does not draw his own bills, to be
made to a person and to the extend, as may specifically be so asked
for, in writing, in this behalf by the government servant concerned.
In  such  a  case,  the  receipt  given  by  the  person  so  authorized  to
receive the sum specified, shall constitute a valid acquittance for the
amount paid to him and the receipt for the balance only, if any, when
paid shall be obtained from the government servant concerned.

(b) As far as possible, a clerk who has helped to prepare a bill for
establishment pay, etc., shall not be allowed to have anything to do with the
disbursement of the pay, etc.

(c) A large office in which it would be inconvenient to watch the
disposal of undisbursed pay and allowances through the office copies of bills
or the acquittance roll shall maintain a register in Form T.R. 22 for the purpose.
The same register shall also be used, when necessary, for watching the disposal
of the undisbursed balances, if any, of amounts drawn on contingent bills in
excess of the permanent advance.

(d) The drawing officer shall either check each acquittance roll himself
by adding up the items, comparing the total of the corresponding establishment
bill and the money received from the treasury, and seeing that any difference
between  the  totals  is  properly  accounted  for,  or  have  it  so  checked  by  a
responsible  government  servant.  The  government  servant  who  checks  an
acquittance roll shall sign a statement at the foot of it as follows:—

“Checked in accordance with Rule 432 (d) of the Kerala Treasury Code.”

(e) A  disbursing  officer  shall  not  make  the  last  payment  of  pay,
allowances, etc., to a government servant who is finally leaving the service of
the  government  on  retirement,  resignation  or  dismissal  or  is  placed  under
suspension,  until  he  has  satisfied  himself  that  no  amount  is  due  to  the
Government  from  the  government  servant.  In  regard  to  the  recovery  of
overpayments, etc., from any such government servant, he shall follow the
detailed procedure laid down in Rule 212. A disbursing officer shall also not
pay, any pay, allowances, etc., due to a deceased government servant to the
heirs of the government servant after his death until he has satisfied himself
that no amount is due to the government from the government servant.

NOTE—For amounts recovered at the time of disbursement of salary from
officials in cash such as recoveries on account of attachment order
issued  from  a  co-operative  society,  a  receipt  should  be  given  as
required in Rule 90 (a).

(d)  DISBURSEMENTS OUT OF THE PERMANENT ADVANCE

433. Every  government  servant  who  has  been  granted  a  permanent
advance shall regularly check the correctness of the balance with the help of
his contingent registers or, if the advance is used for other purposes besides
meeting contingent expenditure, with the help of a register in Form T.R. 96
which he shall maintain for the purpose.

  RULES  434-436

(e)    CUSTODY  OF  VOUCHERS AND ACQUITTANCES

434. All vouchers and acquittances are important documents and should
be filed and preserved carefully in the office concerned, when they are not sent
elsewhere for audit in accordance with the rules.

(f)    CANCELLATION AND  DESTRUCTION  OF  SUB-VOUCHERS

(a)

435.

Sub-vouchers to contingent bills should be ‘cancelled’ in such
a manner that they cannot subsequently be used fraudulently to claim or support
a further payment.

(b) *Whenever a drawing officer signs a fully vouched contingent bill
for  presentation  at  the  Treasury  for  payment  or  a  detailed  contingent  bill  for
submission to the controlling authority, he should at the same time cancel all the
sub-vouchers which relate to the bill. He should endorse the word “cancelled”
across each sub-voucher in red ink or by a rubber stamp, and initial it with date. He
should certify on the bill that all the sub-vouchers relating to it have been so
cancelled that they cannot be used again. When the amount of a sub-voucher
exceeds the permanent advance it should be cancelled as soon as the payment
has been made and entered in the contingent Register.

(c) [Omitted]

In the case of the Public Works Department, every voucher should
be enfaced with the word “checked” over the dated initials of the Divisional
Accountant, as well as of any clerk who may have applied a preliminary check.

PART  VII

  RULES  436-439

Stamps affixed to vouchers should be so cancelled that they cannot be used
again, and, if with this object they are punched through, care should be taken that
the acknowledgment of the payee is not destroyed thereby.

Vouchers relating to new supplies of tools and plant should be completed by
noting  on  them  the  name  of  the  month  in  the  accounts  of  which  the  articles
acquired were brought on the Tools and Plant Received Sheet, Form 12 of Book of
Forms (Public Works Accounts).

437. Government  servants  should  encourage  contractors,  suppliers  of
stores and other persons making claims against the Government to submit their
bills and claims on the proper departmental forms. A disbursing officer should not,
however, reject a bill prepared in another form if it contains all the necessary
details of the claim, but should add any additional particulars that are required.

438. When a contractor or supplier endorses in favour of a bank a bill
payable by the Government, payment should be made to the bank only if he has
also receipted the bill and after verifying the genuineness of the signature in both
the receipt and the request to pay the amount to the bank. For this purpose the
disbursing officer should require the contractor or supplier to furnish a specimen
signature in his presence. If the contractor or supplier has authorized an agent to
draw bills or receive payment on his behalf, the disbursing officer should require
the agent to furnish a specimen signature in his presence and the contractor or
supplier to attest it in his presence. Before paying the amount to the bank, the
disbursing officer should compare the signature on the receipt and the request to
pay the amount to the bank with the specimen signature furnished separately in
his presence and satisfy himself that they are genuine. The disbursing officer
should keep a file of the specimen signature of contractors or suppliers and their
agents for reference.

439. The disbursing officer should see that in every voucher relating to

charge for works, the following particulars are prominently specified:—
(1) the full name of the work as given in the estimate,

(2) the  name  of  the  component  part  (or  sub-head)  of  it,  if  separate

accounts are kept for the several component parts,

(3) the charges, if any, which are of the nature of recoverable payments
and the name, of the contractors or others from whom they are recoverable, and

(4)

the head of account to which the charges are to be debited and that

to which any deduction made in the voucher is to be credited.

PART  VII

  RULES  440-442

440. When a voucher or account exhibits any expenditure from which
revenue may prima facie be expected to accrue, e.g., when a bill includes a charge
for removing material from a building or other work which is being dismantled or
is undergoing repairs or for clearing jungle or cutting trees in the compound of a
building or on the bank of the canal, the account or voucher should show how the
old materials removed or the trees cut have been disposed of, and, if they have
been sold, the approximate date when the sale proceeds will be credited in the
accounts. The Divisional Officer should make a note on each voucher which
includes a charge of this kind as to whether the timber, etc., has any sale value and
if so, by what approximate date the value realized by sale in auction or otherwise
will be credited in the accounts.

441. The disbursing officer should deal with bills received from firms for
the supply of stores in original and submit them to the Accountant General as
vouchers. He should not keep a copy of any such bill in his office, except as
provided for under Rule 430 (e).

*#(B)    SPECIAL TO  CHEQUE  DRAWING  DEPARTMENTS  MENTIONED
  IN  SUB-RULE  (D)  OF  RULE  162

442. When  any  moneys  due  by  the  Government  to  any  person**  any
payable by means of a departmental cheque are attached by a prohibitory order of
a court of law, the disbursing officer should give effect to the court’s order unless
he has reason to think that the amount payable is exempt from attachments, in
which  case  he  should  report  the  matter  to  the  Government  for  orders  before
making the payment. In giving effect to the court’s order, he should deduct the
attached amount from the bill and pass it for the net amount only; if the prohibitory
order  was  issued  by  a  court  not  situated  at  his  headquarters,  he  should  also
deduct from the bill the money order commission required for remitting the amount
to the court. If the court which issued the prohibitory order is situated at his
headquarters, he should remit the attached amount deducted from the bill to the
court by drawing a cheque in its favour on the treasury and sending it to the court
if the court is not situated at his headquarters, he should draw the amount from
the treasury on a cheque and send it (less the money order commission) to the
court by money order. He should invariably obtain a receipt for the attached
amount from the court either before or after remitting the amount to the court. The
receipt  should  show  that  the  payment  is  on  account  of  an  attached  debt  and
should set forth inter alia the name and capacity of the actual creditor to whom

  RULES  442-444

amount is due from the Government and on what account it is due and the
number and date of the court’s attachment order in accordance with which the
amount is paid to the court. If the attached amount relates to a disbursement in
respect of which the rules require that sub-vouchers for amounts in excess of
$  ` 1000 should be sent to the Accountant General, the court’s receipt should,
if it is for an amount of  $ ` 1000 or more, be attached to the relevant bill in which
the particulars of the creditor’s claim are recorded (or sent to the Accountant
General later on to be attached to that bill), and a reference to that bill should be
enfaced on it in red ink. A reference to the court’s receipt should be similarly
enfaced on the bill, if possible.

When the attachment relates to an amount for which a bill has to be drawn
on the treasury, the procedure laid down in Rule 211 should be followed. (See
also Articles 102 and 103 of the Kerala Financial Code).

443. Payments due to contractor may be made direct to a financing bank
provided that the department concerned has obtained (1) a legally valid document,
such  as  a  power  of  attorney  or  transfer  deed  signed  by  the  contractor  and
authorizing the bank to receive the payments due to him by the Government, and
(2) the contractor’s written acceptance of the correctness of the account prepared
to show what is due to him by the Government or his signature on the bill or other
claim preferred against the Government on his behalf, before settlement of the
account or claim by payment to the bank. A receipt given by a bank in favour of
which a contractor has executed a power of attorney or transfer deed authorizing
it to receive payments due to him by the Government constitutes a valid discharge
for the payment due to him, but contractors should, as far as possible, be induced
to present their bills duly receipted and discharged through their bankers.

CHAPTER  III

CURRENCY AND  BANK  NOTES

Instructions issued by the Reserve Bank of India

1. Denominations of Notes.—Under the provisions of the Reserve Bank of
India Act (India Act II of 1934) the sole right to issue bank notes in India has been
vested in the Reserve Bank with effect from the 1st April 1935 and the Government
of India have ceased to issue, currency notes.  The Reserve Bank has taken over
the liability for the currency notes issued by the Government of India.

2. Currency notes of the denominational values of one rupee, five rupees,
ten  rupees,  twenty  rupees,  fifty  rupees,  one  hundred  rupees,  five  hundred
rupees,  one  thousand  rupees  and  ten  thousand  rupees  have  been  issued  by
the Government. Under the provisions of the Reserve Bank of India Act, these
notes are now legal tender throughout India. The issue of currency notes of
the  denominational  value  of  one  rupee,  and  twenty  rupees  has  been
discontinued and currency notes of the other denominational values supplied
by the Government have been issued by the Reserve Bank in addition to its
own notes.

3. Bank notes issued by the Reserve Bank will be of the denominational
values of two rupees, five rupees, ten rupees, one hundred rupees, one thousand
rupees,  five  thousand  rupees  and  ten  thousand  rupees  unless  otherwise
directed by the Government on the recommendations of the Central Board of
the Bank. Bank notes and currency notes issued by the Bank are legal tender
throughout India.
NOTE— Bank notes and currency notes of the denominational values of five
hundred rupees, one thousand rupees, and ten thousand rupees prior
to 13th January 1946 were demonetized with effect from that date and
are no longer legal tender. Bank notes of the denominational values
of  one  thousand  rupees,  five  thousand  rupees  and  ten  thousand
rupees in the Asoka Pillar design have been issued with effect from
1st April 1954 and are legal tender.

RECEIPT AND ISSUE OF NOTES

4. One  rupee  notes  issued  by  the  Central  Government  are  unlimited
legal tender, and although these notes are treated as rupee coin for all purposes
of the Reserve Bank of India Act, the instructions contained in the following

333

PART  VIII

  Instructions  5-10

paragraphs will, save where the contrary intention appears, apply to these
notes as they apply to currency and bank notes.

5. No  restrictions  are  imposed  on  the  issue  of  notes  at  treasuries  in

exchange for coin or for notes of other denominations.

6. Although  no  person  has  a  legal  claim  to  obtain  coin  for  notes
presented at treasury, this accommodation should be given whenever possible,
and all applications for exchange should be granted, provided that the coins
or notes applied for are available, subject to any general or special limitations
which the Reserve Bank or the Government of India may find it necessary to
impose from time to time.

7. Subject to any limitations which may be imposed in particular cases
the Treasury Officer should, whenever he is satisfied that no inconvenience
will be caused to the treasury, exhibit in some conspicuous place a placard in
English and the Indian language in local use notifying that he is prepared to
give coin for notes.

NOTE 1—Notes  to  limited  extent  may  be  cashed  for  the  convenience  to
travellers when the treasury is unable to cash them for the general
public.

NOTE 2—Facilities should be given as far as possible for encashment of

notes at sub treasuries.

8. Whenever there are reasons to believe that notes are selling in the
local market at a discount or a premium in large amounts, the Treasury Officer
should at once bring the fact to the notice of the Currency Officer.

9. The ordinary exchange with the public mentioned in Instructions 5 to
7 should be made from the treasury balance. When, however, the amount of
rupees or notes of any denomination in the treasury balance is insufficient to
meet the demand for exchanges, rupees or notes of the required denominations
may be obtained from the currency chest in accordance with Rule 152 (iv) of
the Kerala Treasury Code.

10. It is desirable from the point of view of the popularity of the note
issue that clean notes only should be put into circulation. This has, at the
same time, the advantage of making it more difficult for forged notes to escape
detection, as these are frequently intentionally soiled or smudged in order to
conceal their defects. In the case of district treasuries, however it is not feasible
entirely to discontinue reissue, but Currency Officer will arrange to keep the

  Instructions    10-14

treasuries in their jurisdiction supplied with sufficient stocks of clean notes in
order to meet all probable demands. Notes much soiled, defaced or torn should
not in any case be reissued to the public and cut notes should not ordinarily
be reissued. Notes unfit for reissue should be sent to the Issue Department of
the  Reserve  Bank  (or  the  treasury  named  by  the  Currency  Officer  for  the
purpose) in the first remittance sent thither in accordance with rule 332 of the
Kerala Treasury Code.

FORGED, DEFECTIVE AND LOST NOTES

14. (a) In the event of a forged note being presented, the note and the
presenter should be made over to the Police, if the Treasury Officer considers it
advisable to do so. If, however, the Treasury Officer is convinced that the presenter
has presented the forged note in good faith, believing that it was genuine he
should impound the note and take the name and address of the presenter and his
statement regarding the person from whom he received the note. The forged note
and presenter’s statement should be sent to the Police for further enquiry. After
the enquiry has been completed, the Police will forward the forged note to the
Issue Department of the Reserve Bank along with a report.

NOTE— When a forged note is impounded, it should be stamped with the word
‘Forged’ or the word “Forged” should be written on it in red in large
letters before it is sent to the Police for enquiry.

  Instructions  14-16

(b) Notes disfigured by oil or other substances should be scrutinized
with special care, as forged notes are sometimes intentionally thus disfigured
to render detection difficult.

(c) The managers of certain joint stock banks and exchange banks
have  instructions  to  send  forged  notes  presented  to  them  to  the  nearest
treasury  for  impounding.  When  a  Treasury  Officer  receives  a  forged  note
from a bank he should take action in accordance with clause (a) above.

(d) The Reserve Bank has authorized the Head Offices and other
offices, branches, sub-branches and Treasury Pay Offices of the State Bank
of  India  and  the  branches  of  its  subsidiary  banks  conducting  Government
business to impound forged notes.

(e) At places where there is neither an Issue Department of the Reserve
Bank nor a branch, sub-branch or Treasury Pay Office of the agency bank, treasury
and sub treasury officers are authorized to accept, for disposal in the usual manner,
suspected currency or bank notes tendered by Post and Telegraph Office.

When suspected notes sent to treasuries by Post Offices or managers
of joint stock banks for adjudication are adjudged by Treasury Officers as
genuine their value will be accounted for under the head “Civil Deposits—
Revenue  Deposits”,  pending  repayment  of  the  amount  to  the  parties
concerned. If these deposits remain unclaimed for one whole account year,
they lapse to the credit of the Central Government.

NOTE— These  instructions  apply mutatis  mutandis  to  coins  send  by  Post

Offices to Treasury Officers.

15. No person is of right entitled to recover the value of any lost, stolen,
mutilated or imperfect currency or bank notes, but rules have been framed
under the Reserve Bank of India Act prescribing the circumstances, conditions
and limitations under which the value of such notes may be refunded as of
grace. The rules are contained in Appendix 24.

16. Half mutilated, mismatched or altered notes and notes disfigured by oil
or other substances in such manner as to render their identification doubtful,
should never be received in payment of Government dues or cashed. The holder
should be advised to apply to the Currency Officer competent to deal with the
matter in accordance with the rules in Appendix 24 for instructions regarding the
procedure under which the value of such notes can in some cases be recovered.

  Instructions  16-20

NOTE   1—Notes with only a slight mutilation which does not interfere with
identification or suggest fraud may be received at the treasury and dealt with
under Rule 332. The features necessary for the identification of a note are,
besides the number, which must, including the serial letters be all intact, the
denomination,  the  place  of  issue  where  indicated,  the  signature  and  the
watermark.

NOTE 2—Defective  notes  should  be  stamped  with  “Half  note-Payment
refused”, “Mutilated-Payment refused”, “Mismatched-Payment
refused”, or “Altered-Payment refused” as the case may be, or
such words should be written in red ink in large letters before
they are returned to the presenter.

17.

The  value  of  lost,  stolen  or  wholly  destroyed  notes  of  the
denomination of   ` 100 and below will not be refunded. Persons applying to a
Treasury Officer for a refund of the value of lost, stolen or wholly destroyed notes
of the denomination above ` 100 should be referred to the Currency Officer of any
office of issue.

18.

Procedure in treasuries the cash business of which is conducted
by the Bank.—The provisions in Instructions 1-17 apply mutatis mutandis to
treasuries the cash business of which is conducted by the Bank.

INDENTS  FOR  NOTES

19.

The Treasury Officer is responsible for keeping the currency chest
and treasury balances sufficiently stocked with all denominations of notes to
provide for issue to the public in payments on behalf of the Government and
in exchange for coins. He should, as far as possible, submit to the Currency
Officer his requisitions for the supply of notes with the Cash Balance Report.
Ordinarily,  remittances  of  notes  will  be  sent  to  the  district  treasury  and
distributed to sub treasuries by the Treasury Officer, but in certain cases, e.g.,
when  a  sub  treasury  is  on  a  Railway,  it  may  be  more  economical  to  send
remittances to a sub treasury for distribution.

20.

At places where the cash business of the treasury is conducted
by the Bank, the Manager or Agent of the Bank is responsible for keeping in
the currency chest a sufficient stock of notes to meet all demands from the
public at the district treasury and also demands from the Treasury Officer for
supply to sub treasuries. When the Treasury Officer wishes to replenish the
stock of notes in a sub treasury, he will obtain the necessary supply of notes

from the bank unless the sub treasury requirements are large and it is more
economical  and  convenient  to  obtain  a  direct  remittance  from  an  Issue
Department of the Reserve Bank. In the case of treasuries the cash business
of which is conducted by the branches of the agency Bank, the Agent of the
Bank will submit his indents for supply of notes to his Local Head Office or
Link Branch which will arrange with the Currency Officer for the necessary
remittance.

CHAPTER  IV

Cypher Code and Treasury Agencies
Private Check Signal Book

1. The Currency Officer of the Reserve Bank of India, Delhi, supplies
Cypher Code and Treasury agencies Private Check Signal Book of the Reserve
Bank of India to each Treasury Officer and to the Sub Treasury Officer of each
sub treasury which has a currency chest. The Cypher Code contains a list of
phrases and expressions ordinarily required in telegraphic communications
on matters concerning resource, currency and transactions under the Reserve
Bank of India’s scheme of remittance facilities and as such it should be used
for telegrams relating to such matters. The Check Signal Book should be used
for authenticating all telegrams relating to telegraphic transfers.

2. Safe  custody  of  Code  and  Check  Signal  Books.—The  Code  and
Check Signal Books are confidential and shall be kept locked up carefully
overnight, and during the day when they are not in actual use, in a safe or in
the strong room. The keys of the safe or the receptacle in which the books are
kept shall remain in the personal custody of the Officer-in-charge of the Treasury
or sub treasury or of any other government servant duly authorized in this
behalf. If the books are kept in box or other receptacle as provided above, the
latter must be kept in a safe or in the strong room overnight. When the books
are taken out for use during day, they must invariably remain in the personal
custody of the government servants mentioned above, and must, on no account,
be allowed out of their possession. All spare copies of the Code and Check Signal
Book must invariably remain in a safe or in the strong room. Negligence in the
observance of these instructions may involve Government and Reserve Bank in
considerable loss before protective measures could be adopted. Holders shall,
therefore, exercise extreme care in regard to the custody and handling of these
books.

3. Procedure  to  be  followed  in  connection  with  the  distribution  and
acknowledgement of amendment slips.—Amendments to the Code and Check
Signal Book will be distributed by the Currency Officer, Delhi, in the form of
confidential circular letters with acknowledgement forms appended to them. The
covers will be despatched by Registered Post Acknowledgement due, direct to all
holders. Immediately on receipt of the confidential circular the acknowledgement
form appended to it shall be duly completed by the holders, and returned by
Ordinary Post to the Currency Officer.

4. Procedure  to  be  followed  in  dealing  with  amendment  slips.—
Immediately on receipt of an amendment slip, the reference number and date
appearing thereon shall be serially recorded on the fly leaf at the beginning of the
Cypher Code or Check Signal Book, as the case may be, under the signature of the
Officer-in-charge. No correction shall , however, be made at the appropriate place
in the books until the date from which the amendment takes effect. For this purpose,
a careful diary note shall be taken of the date from which the amendment comes
into force which will be stated in the covering letter and/or each slip and thereafter
the amendment slip shall be carefully filed along with the covering letter, if any, on
a special file expressly opened for the purpose. On the day the amendment becomes
effective the relative slip shall be removed from the special file, cut out and pasted
at the appropriate place in the books, a suitable note of the amendment being
made in the proper place. Should it be found more convenient to carry out the
amendments in manuscript in the body of the books instead of pasting the relative
slips therein, there is no objection to that course being adopted, but in that event
it is imperative that the amendment slips shall be carefully retained on the separate
file referred to above. On the date on which each amendment becomes effective
the fact that the amendment has been carried out shall be noted in a separate
column, under the signature of the Officer-in-charge against the entry already
made on the flyleaf when the amendment slip was received.

Where files are used for recording amendment slip or the covering letters of
both, the above instructions for the safe custody of the Code Books shall apply
mutatis mutandis to such files. All spare copies of amendment slips must also be
kept in a safe or in the strong room.

5. Procedure to be followed in the event of the Cypher Code, Check
Signal or amendment thereto being lost or falling into unauthorized hands.—
Should the Cypher or the Check Signal Book get lost or fall into unauthorized
hands at any time the fact shall immediately be reported by telegrams to the
Chief Accountant of the Reserve Bank of India at Bombay (telegraphic address

posts, and the leave, pension and other rules applicable to its servant;

(2)

the moneys received and administered by any other specified
body when the Government have published a special notification to the effect

In the case of payments of water charges in the Public Health
Engineering Department, the rounding off shall be done as follows:-In the
case of all payments up to a bill amount of  ` 10 the odd paise will be eliminated
and the bills rounded off to the higher even paise. But where the bill amount
exceeds ` 10 the bill should be rounded off to the multiple of 5 paise.

PAYMENT  BY  POSTAGE  STAMPS

XVII. (1)

In cases where moneys due by Government to a payee are
to be remitted to him by Money Order at his cost and the exact amount cannot
be paid by Money Order after deducting Money Order Commission, postage
stamps of equal value may be sent to him by ordinary post, for the amount
less than one rupee left over after remitting the maximum amount by Money
Order. The acknowledgement of the payee on the money order receipt shall,
as usual, be watched by the disbursing officer, but it is not necessary to call
for a formal receipt from the payee concerned on the value of the postage
stamps and it would suffice if only a certificate to this effect is recorded by the
disbursing officer against the entry recording the payment.**

O R D E R

As  per  Government  Order  1st  read  above,  sanction  was  accorded  to
operationalise the system of disbursement of salaries and personal entitlements
except  retirement  benefits  of  Non-Gazetted  employees  of  all  Government
Departments, through nationalised banks on optional basis.  This order was
cancelled vide reference 2nd cited in the wake of proposal to introduce ATM
in Treasuries.  Accordingly, instructions were issued to follow the procedure
prescribed in the Kerala Treasury Code for salary disbursement vide circular
read 3rd above.  As per G.O read 4th above, Government have ordered that
disbursement of salaries and entitlement of all Self Drawing Officers in the
State should be made through their Treasury Savings Banks accounts with
effect from 1.1.2011.

2.  The full computerization of treasuries to facilitate introduction of
ATM in Treasuries has not materialised so far.  Now, major Head of Departments
like State Police Chief, Transport Commissioner, etc. have pointed out difficulties
in  handling  huge  amount  of  physical  cash,  especially  in  respect  of  those

employees who are deployed for field duty and requested for sanction by the
Government for disbursement of pay and allowance of their employees through
their bank accounts.  Those Departments, which had earlier switched over to
the system of salary payments through banks, also expressed their difficulties
in moving away from that system.  Reserve Bank of India has also suggested
the State Government to consider switching over to e-mode of transactions
by using Electronic Clearance Service (ECS), National Electronic Fund Transfer
(NEFT),  etc.    Further,  Government  also  consider  that  fruits  of  advanced
technology in banking system like ATM, mobile banking, etc. should not be
denied to its employees.

3.  In the above backdrop, Government have reviewed the position in
its  entirety  and  are  pleased  to  reintroduce  the  system  of  disbursement  of
personal entitlements except retirement benefits of all government employees
including Self Drawing Officers in the State through Public Sector Bank account
of the employee concerned on an optional basis in supersession of all orders
issued in this regard.  The heads of offices should obtain willingness of their
employees before switching over to the new system of payment.

4.  In order to implement the system of disbursement of entitlements
except retirement benefits of non-Gazetted employees through an authorised
bank, the following procedures shall be followed.

(i) The Drawing and Disbursing Officer concerned shall present the
bills relating to the personal claims of Non-Gazetted employees through the
bill  book  to  the  Treasury  Officer  for  passing  the  bills  after  exercising  the
prescribed  checks,  together  with  the  authorisation  in  favour  of  the  Bank
Manager to encash and credit the proceeds of the bill in accordance with the
statement attached.  Together with the bill, the Drawing and Disbursing Officer
will present a statement containing the details relating to each employee such
as full name with initials, designation, Savings Bank account number, Net
amount due to the individual as per the bill, details of amount to be deducted
from the net amount (such as Co-operative recoveries, Profession tax, etc.),
the name and address of those to whom these amounts are payable and the
mode of payment (DD/account transfer, etc.) and the final amount to be credited
to the savings bank account of the persons concerned.  If required by the
bank, these details shall be made available in a floppy disk/CD also.

(ii) Self Drawing  Officers  shall present their bills  to the treasury

with a request to credit the proceeds of the bill to the bank account of their
choice along with the details mentioned above.  The Treasury officer after
exercising proper checks, shall pass the bill and send credit advice to the
bank concerned, showing the net amount to be credited to the bank account
of the officer concerned and the amount to be transfer-credited such as co-
operative dues, profession tax, etc. with the required details.

(iii) The Drawing and Disbursing Officers shall ensure that the net
amount,  after  co-operative  recoveries  and  other  recoveries,  due  to  the
employees  is  credited  to  the  individual  account  concerned  and  also  that
recoveries effected from the net amount of the bill are remitted by the bank to
the societies or other agencies concerned under proper acknowledgement.

(iv) The procedure now followed by Treasury will continue and will
issue  Pay  Order  Cheque  to  the  Bank.    In  the  Pay  Order  Cheque  “Pay
` …………… in cash” shall be replaced by “Pay `. ……………..by crediting to
SB account and `…………………..by DD/account transfer.”

(v) After effecting the deductions from the net amount towards dues
to the Societies or other agencies in accordance with the statement furnished
by the Drawing and Disbursing Officer, the bank will credit the amount to the
Savings Bank account of the employees concerned in any bank/branch where
the employee has a live bank account.  The Bank will ensure, in the case of pay
and allowances that credit is allowed only on the date due for disbursement of
salary.  The bank shall also intimate the employee concerned about the amount
credited to the account through SMS alerts.

(vi)  The bank will furnish to the Drawing and Disbursing Officer, a
certified statement containing the details of credit particulars and remittances
of deductions made as per the statement in respect of each employee after
remitting  the  deductions  made  from  the  ‘net  amount’  to  the  institutions
concerned, in the format in which the details were furnished by the Drawing
and Disbursing Officer.

(vii) The services rendered by the banks will be free of service charges.

(viii) The  Drawing  and  Disbursing  Officer  and  the  authorised
signatory of the bank will enter into a comprehensive agreement incorporating
the above conditions before introducing the system.

  5.      The following modifications to the provisions in the Kerala Treasury

351

                                                   KERALA TREASURY CODE

Code are ordered to facilitate the new dispensation.

(i) The existing Rule 163 (k) Kerala Treasury Code Volume I shall be

modified as follows:

“Recoveries from the salary of government servants on account of dues
to co-operative societies registered under the various Co-operative Societies
Acts where such Acts impose a statutory obligation on the Government to
make such deductions shall be made by the drawing and disbursing officers
or the authorized banks  in the case of Non-Gazetted Government servants
who do not draw their own bills, and in other cases by the Treasury Officers
or the authorized banks/other disbursing officers concerned, as the case may
be, in accordance with such procedure as may be laid down by Government
from time to time”.

(ii) First paragraph of Rule 432(a) Kerala Treasury Code Volume I

shall be modified as follows:

“The head of an office is personally responsible for all moneys drawn
as pay, leave salary, allowances, etc. on an establishment bill signed by him or
on his behalf until he has paid them to the persons who are entitled to receive
them or credited them to the bank account of the persons who are entitled to
receive them and has obtained their acknowledgement, duly stamped when
necessary.  If disbursement of the amount drawn in the bill is through the
authorised bank by crediting the amount to the savings bank account of the
persons who are entitled to receive them, the Drawing and Disbursing Officer
shall be personally responsible for obtaining the details of amount credited
to  the  savings  bank  account  of  the  employees  concerned.    These
acknowledgements  shall  be  taken  as  a  rule  on  the  office  copy  of  the  bill.
When the head of the office concerned considers than an establishment is so
large, or scattered that the payees acknowledgements cannot, without undue
inconvenience, be obtained on the office copy of the bill, he shall maintain a
separate  aquittance  roll  in  Form  TR  95  and  obtain  the  payees’
acknowledgements therein.  In offices where the entitlements are disbursed
through banks, acknowledgements shall be obtained on the office copy of
the  bill  or  on  the  aquittance  roll  in  Form  TR  95  after  getting  the  credit
details from the Bank”.
