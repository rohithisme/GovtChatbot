Amendment) Rules, 2019. 
 (2) They shall be deemed to have come into force on the 16th day of July, 2014. 2. Amendment of the Rules.- In Part III of the Kerala Service Rules,-  
 (1) in Note 5 to rule 62, the words “scale of” shall be omitted;  
 (2) in Note 2 to sub-rule (5) of rule 90, the words “scale of” shall be omitted. 
 By order of the Governor,  SANJEEV KAUSHIK IAS 
 Principal Secretary (Finance Expenditure). 
Explanatory Note 
      (This does not form part of the notification, but is intended to indicate its general purport.)  As per the existing provisions in Part III of the Kerala Service Rules, notional pay consequent on change in scale of pay due to General pay revision or otherwise shall be reckoned for calculating Death-cum-Retirement Gratuity and Family Pension. But there is no provision at present for calculating Death-cum-Retirement Gratuity and Family Pension based on change in pay in the same scale of pay. Hence, the Government have decided to make suitable amendments to Part III of the Kerala Service Rules to rectify the above mentioned anomaly. 
 The notification is intended to achieve the above object.
