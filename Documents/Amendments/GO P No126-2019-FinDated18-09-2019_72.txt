Explanatory Note  
      (This does not form part of the notification, but is intended to indicate its general purport.)  
      As per the rules in Appendix - XIII under Chapter VI of Part III, Kerala Service Rules, in addition to the service pension or family pension, an extraordinary pension may be awarded to a Government official or his family who has been sick or injured or died while performing official duties. As many other schemes such as Group Personal Accident Insurance Scheme, Ex gratia Payment etc. are being implemented for the well-being of the employees, Government have decided to withdraw the extraordinary Pension. Inorder to give statutory validity to the above said decision, the Government have decided to amend Part III of the Kerala Service Rules suitably. The Extra Ordinary Pension specified in ruling below rule 102 is related to the Defence Service Rules and hence the same is included in the rules.  
The notification is intended to achieve the above object.
