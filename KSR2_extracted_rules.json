Government Decisions 1. In the case of an employee who is compulsorily retired as a measure of penalty and sanctioned a reduced pension in accordance with the provisions of Rule 6 a further reduction under this rule may not be made. 2. (a) This rule cannot be used directly to effect a penal recovery, but Government are justified in making proof of a specific instance of fraud or negligence by an employee, the grounds for a finding that his service has not been thoroughly satisfactory within the meaning of this rule for the purpose of reducing his pension. (b) The measure of the reduction in the amount of pension made under this rule should be the extent by which the employee’s service as a whole has failed to reach thoroughly satisfactory, standard and any attempt to equate the amount of reduction with the amount of loss caused to Government is incorrect. (c) This rule contemplates permanent reduction in the amount of pension ordinarily admissible and does not admit of the reduction of the pension payable in respect of any one particular year. 3. *Minimum pension is fixed in consideration of the bare subsistence needs and given a delinquent officer a pension sufficient to maintain a subsistence level, will not therefore be misplaced leniency. Government have, therefore, decided that minimum pension will be admissible even in cases where pension is ordered to be reduced as a punishment."

It is essential that there should prima facie grounds for making payment on the production of an indemnity bond to the person claiming it. Such ground can exist only if he is shown by a sworn declaration to be a de-facto guardian and his bonafides have been ascertained. Even if a guardian has not yet been appointed by the court, if the minor and his property are in the custody of some person, such person is in law de-facto guardian. The authorities making the payment should therefore, require the person who comes forward to claim payment on behalf of the minor, to satisfy them by an affidavit that he is in charge of the person and property of the minor and is looking after it or that, if the minor has no property other than the gratuity the minor is in his custody and care. The affidavit so to be produced is in addition to the indemnity bond with suitable sureties. Note 3: In cases where the surviving parent happens to be a Muslim lady and where the aggregate amount of the gratuity due to her minor children does not exceed one thousand rupees, the share of the death-cum-retirement gratuity due to them will be paid to her on production of a certificate issued by the Tahasildar in whose jurisdiction the beneficiaries live, that the minor children are under her care and custody.
