Normally the forms should be presented at the Post Office nearest to the treasury where the routine transactions of the treasury are carried out.

The District Treasury Officer has power to order the opening of a temporary  currency  chest  at  a  sub  treasury  in  his  district  when  necessary. He should report the opening of a temporary chest and the amount of the first deposit into it by telegram to the Currency Officer. Under the provisions of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (India Act II of 1934), the total amount of the currency and Bank notes in circulation, which constitute the liabilities of the Issue Department of the Bank, should not exceed the assets held by the Issue Department in gold, sterling securities, rupee coin and rupee securities.

If, however, the Treasury Officer is convinced that the presenter has presented the forged note in good faith, believing that it was genuine he should impound the note and take the name and address of the presenter and his statement regarding the person from whom he received the note. The forged note and presenter’s statement should be sent to the Police for further enquiry. After the enquiry has been completed, the Police will forward the forged note to the Issue Department of the Reserve Bank along with a report. NOTE— When a forged note is impounded, it should be stamped with the word ‘Forged’ or the word “Forged” should be written on it in red in large letters before it is sent to the Police for enquiry."
