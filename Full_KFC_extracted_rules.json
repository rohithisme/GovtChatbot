When this procedure would cause inconvenience, sanctions may be communicated over the signature of the non- gazetted Government servant who is the Head Ministerial Officer of the Office, provided that this arrangement is intimated beforehand to the Accountant General by the sanctioning authority. Note 1:– Financial sanctions communicated to audit should invariably be signed in ink by the sanctioning authority or other officers authorised for the purpose. No action will be taken in audit on copies of financial sanctions issued over facimile and cyclostyled signatures of sanctioning authorities or other authorised officers."

Repairs and maintenance include all the operations required from time to time to maintain existing properties in a satisfactory state and make good the damage due to wear and tear, when complete reconstruction is not necessary. Repairs are further classified as “ordinary repairs” and “special repairs”. Ordinary repairs include the periodical repairs which are done regularly as a matter of routine and are usually of the same nature (e.g., painting or white-washing a building or spreading a new coating of metal on a road), and any occasional petty repairs from time to time, which may have to be carried out between the time fixed for the periodical repairs. Ordinary repairs to an irrigation work include all the operations required to maintain the work in a satisfactory state as it is, i.e., to the standard already laid down. Special repairs are repairs, which are not periodical or frequent e.g., re-roofing a building, replacing beams or renewing a floor. Special repairs to an irrigation work include all operations undertaken with a view to maintaining the work in a better condition, i.e., to a higher standard than that already laid down, by using materials of a more lasting kind, without increasing the efficiency or the scope of the system, e.g., substituting cement plastering or pointing for ordinary plastering or pointing, substituting plastering for pointing, substituting rough stone masonary for dry stone packing, revetting tank bunds at the sites of beaches and river margins where they are eroded, grouting newly the surface of aprons and revetments and lengthening aprons and revetments to protect the eroded por"

Certain operations are partly original works and partly repairs, e.g., substitutions of a terraced roof for a tiled roof, substitution of steel beams for damaged teak ones, or dismantling and extending a verandah. A mixed work of this kind should, for the purpose of determining the authority competent to sanction it, be treated as an original work. When a structure or a part of a structure is dismantled because it is structurally unsound and replaced by a new work which in all material essentials merely reproduces what was dismantled, the work is included in the category of repairs, unless it is done to make newly purchased or previously abandoned building usable.

(3) (a) Whenever an administrative authority holds that a Government servant is responsible for a loss sustained by the Government, it should always consider both whether the whole or any part of the loss should be recovered from him in money and whether any other form of disciplinary action should be taken. In deciding the amount to be recovered, it should consider not only the circumstances of the loss but also the Government servant’s financial position, since the penalty should not be such as to impair his future efficiency. (b) Whenever a loss is held to be due to fraud on the part of a Government servant or servants, every endeavour should be made to recover the whole amount lost from the guilty persons. If the failure of a superior officer to exercise proper supervision and control has facilitated the fraud, he should be called strictly to account and suitably dealt with after carefully assessing his personal responsibility in the matter, e.g., by recovering from him in money a suitable proportion of the loss, or by stopping his increments or reducing the pay. (c) Whenever any Government property or equipment is lost, damaged or destroyed on account of the carelessness of a Government servant to whom it is entrusted (e.g., a police-man’s rifle, a factory motor, lorry or an Engineer’s instruments), the appropriate administrative authority should always consider whether the amount of the loss sustained by the Government should not be recovered in full up to the limit of the Government servant’s capacity to pay. Note:— Interest at 18 per cent per annum or at such rate as fixed by Government from time to time should be charged."

(c) Loss or extra expenditure arising out of administrative lapses e.g., payment of demurrage charges, payment of surcharge (Final) on electricity bills and Radio Licence fees, expenditure incurred in excess of one’s powers not ratified by the competent authority, purchases effected in violation of Stores Purchase Rules resulting in extra expenditure, printing charges to private firms in excess of approved rates, sanctioning posts in schools in excess of the limits prescribed, irregular grant of fee concessions, stipends, etc., loss of revenue due to wrong assessment of claims becoming time-barred, etc. Recovery in cash is called for in respect of categories (a) and (b). In regard to category (c), cash recovery should ordinarily arise only if mala fides are proved. The term “malafides” may be defined in this context as a state of mind where the Officer may be deemed to have acted with the intention to be benefited directly or indirectly by such action. In other cases falling under category (c), it should be seen whether the types of irregularities previously pointed out have been repeated. If the irregularities have been repeated or are of a serious nature or magnitude, the question of taking other forms of disciplinary action if the officer concerned is still in service or of reducing pension under the Service Rules if already retired, should be considered."
