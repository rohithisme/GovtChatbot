        "Description":"A permanent monthly Travelling Allowance may be granted by Government to any officer whose duties require him to travel extensively. Such an allowance is granted in lieu of all other forms of Travelling Allowance for journeys within the officer\u2019s sphere of duty and is drawn all the year round, whether the officer is absent from his headquarters or not.\nGovernment Decision No. 1\nSince Permanent Travelling Allowance is fixed at a monthly rate it is not necessary that the officer should be on tour beyond 8 kilometres from headquarters on all days of the month. Even for days he is not on tour outside 8 kilometres from headquarters he can draw Permanent Travelling Allowance. This does not however mean that Permanent Travelling Allowance can be drawn without leaving headquarters on any day of the month. The drawal of the allowance will be governed by the order fixing the rate of Permanent Travelling Allowance and prescribing the terms and conditions for its drawal. For the drawal of full amount of Permanent Travelling Allowance an officer should be on tour outside 8 kilometres from headquarters for 15 days in a month and should spend at least 6 hours outside headquarters on each such day. If the minimum number of days of travel is not performed reduction has to be made as per the terms and conditions of the Permanent Travelling Allowance\nThis decision shall be deemed to have come into force with effect from 9th December 1970.\nGovernment Decision No. 2\nThe following procedure will be followed for drawal of P.T.A in cases where an officer is on duty for a part of a month and also in cases where the officer has been on duty for the whole month but has not toured for the minimum number of days prescribed :-\n(a) If an officer is on duty for a part of a month he will be allowed proportionate P.T.A. for the days he is on duty provided that the officer is on tour for the proportionate number of days with reference to the minimum days of tour prescribed.\n(b) For every day short toured, a deduction of will ( I x PTA) \/ Y be made where Y is the minimum number of days of tour prescribed.\nExample.- Suppose an officer whose P.T.A. is Rs. 40 per mensem, and whose minimum period of touring is fixed as 20 days per month, is on duty only for 20 days in a month of 30 days. He is entitled to a P.T.A. of Rs. (20 x 40)\/30 = Rs. 26.67 provided, he puts in not less than the proportionate number of tour days, i.e., (20 x 20)\/30 = 13 days. For every day short toured by him a deduction of 1\/20 of Rs. 40 will be made (i.e., if he tours only for 12 days, an amount of Rs. 2 will be deducted from Rs. 26.67).\n(c) In cases where the officer is on duty for the whole month but has not toured for the minimum number of days prescribed, a deduction of (X x P.T.A) \/ Y will be made where X and Y are the shortfall in the number of days of tour and the minimum number of days of tour prescribed in a month respectively.\nExample.- Suppose an officer whose P.T.A is Rs. 40 per mensem and whose minimum number of tour days is fixed as 20 per month, is on duty for the whole month and tours only for 15 days, a deduction of 5 x 40\/20 = Rs. 10 is to be made from his P.T.A. of Rs. 40 per mensem.\nEffective from 8th June 1962."

On their receipt, he shall draw up the pension papers and forward them to the pension sanctioning authority .The pension sanctioning authority will sanction the death-cum-retirement gratuity and the family pension, if any, and send the pension papers to the Audit Officer. After verification, the Audit Officer shall authorize the payment of the amount of death- cum-retirement gratuity and issue family pension payment order on the authority of the orders recorded by the pension sanctioning authority\n(2) If the employee has not executed a nomination in the prescribed form or in cases where the nomination made does not subsist, the head of the office\/department shall arrange to conduct an enquiry to ascertain who are the surviving members of the family eligible to receive the death-cum-retirement gratuity and family pension. On receipt of the enquiry report in the form in Annexure III, he shall obtain from the surviving eligible members an application in Form 6, draw up the pension papers in respect of the deceased non-gazetted employee and forward them to the pension sanctioning authority. If the claimant for family pension is the father or the mother, etc., the Head of Office\/ department should satisfy himself that the conditions laid down in Rules 81, 84, and 90, as the case may be are fulfilled before forwarding the pension papers to the pension sanctioning authority. The pension sanctioning authority shall, after recording his orders sanctioning death-cum-retirement gratuity and family pension, pass on the pension papers to the Audit Officer for authorizing the payment of the amount of death-cum-retirement gratuity and issuing family pension payment order. The enquiry report along with the application in Form 6 from the surviving eligible members of the family of a deceased Gazetted Government Employee shall be passed on to the Audit Officer who shall complete the Form 6 and forward it to the pension sanctioning authority for recording his orders for the payment of the death-cum-retirement gratuity and the family pension. After recording the orders of the Pension Sanctioning authority on the Pension application, it shall be forwarded to the Audit Officer for authorizing payment of the amount of death-cum-retirement gratuity and issuing Pension Payment Order.\n(3) When the gratuity is payable under clauses (1) and (2) above to the minor. \u2013 If the amount or share of the gratuity is payable to a minor, it will be paid to the natural guardian of the minor, and in the absence of a natural guardian, to the person who produces a guardianship certificate. A descriptive roll in duplicate of the person who may be authorized to receive payment should accompany the application in Form 6;\n\u2020 Provided that where the minor child is under the care of a de facto guardian while the natural guardian is alive and the natural guardian consents to the payment of amount or share of the gratuity to the de facto guardian, it shall be payable to de facto guardian, on production by him of-\n(i) A certificate from the Tahasildar of the Taluk to the effect that the minor is under the care and custody of the de facto guardian;\n(ii) The written consent of the natural guardian duly attested by two witnesses; and\n(iii) An indemnity bond in Form 8 A\nNote 1 :\u2013The legal position as to whom the capacity of minor natural guardian\/legal guardian, the share of a minor would be payable is explained as under: -\n(i) Where no valid nomination subsists. \u2013\n(a) When a share payable to minor sons or minor unmarried daughters it should be paid to the surviving parent except in the case when the surviving parent happens to be a Muslim lady, where, however, there is no surviving parent, or the surviving parent is a Muslim lady, payment will have to be made to the persons producing the guardianship certificate.\n(b) When a share is payable to a widowed minor daughter production of a guardianship certificate would be necessary.\n(c) If in a rare case the wife herself happens to be a minor the death-cum-retirement gratuity payable to her shall be paid to the persons producing the guardianship certificate.\n(d) When there are no surviving members of the family as in items (a), (b), (c) and (d) of Rule 71 and the death-cum-retirement gratuity becomes payable to a minor brother or a minor unmarried sister, the payment should be made to the father or, in his absence the mother of the beneficiary except in the case where the mother happens to be a Muslim lady. If the death-cum-retirement gratuity becomes payable to a minor child of a predeceased son, payment should be made to the mother of the beneficiary except in the case where the mother happens to be a Muslim lady. In these cases too, if there is no surviving parent or the surviving parent happens to be a Muslim lady, the payment shall be made to the person producing the guardianship certificate. If any share is payable to a widowed minor sister, the production of a guardianship certificate would be necessary.\n(ii) Where a valid nomination subsists. \u2013\n(a) Where the nomination is in respect of one or more of the minor members of the family, the position stated above would apply.\n(b) Where there is no family, the nomination in favour of an illegitimate child, or a married sister would also be valid. The position would, therefore, be as follows: -\n(i) If the nominee is an illegitimate child, share will be payable to the mother, and, in her absence the production of a guardianship certificate would be necessary.\n(ii) If the share is payable a married minor girl, the share will be payable to the husband.\nExplanation: The term \u201csurviving parent\u201d mentioned in Note 1 (i) above does not include \u201c surviving step mother\u201d.\nNote 2 :\u2013Payment of death-cum-retirement gratuity to the extent of Rs.*100000 (or the first Rs. *100000 where the amount payable exceeds Rs.*100000) in favour of a minor may be made to his\/her guardian in the absence of a natural guardian, without the production of a formal guardianship certificate but subject to the production of an indemnity bond in Form 8A with two suitable solvent sureties to the satisfaction of the sanctioning authority. The balance in excess of Rs.*100000, if any, would become payable on the production of a certificate of guardianship.\nIt is essential that there should prima facie grounds for making payment on the production of an indemnity bond to the person claiming it. Such ground can exist only if he is shown by a sworn declaration to be a de-facto guardian and his bonafides have been ascertained. Even if a guardian has not yet been appointed by the court, if the minor and his property are in the custody of some person, such person is in law de-facto guardian. The authorities making the payment should therefore, require the person who comes forward to claim payment on behalf of the minor, to satisfy them by an affidavit that he is in charge of the person and property of the minor and is looking after it or that, if the minor has no property other than the gratuity the minor is in his custody and care. The affidavit so to be produced is in addition to the indemnity bond with suitable sureties.\nNote 3 :\u2013In cases where the surviving parent happens to be a Muslim lady and where the aggregate amount of the gratuity due to her minor children does not exceed one thousand rupees, the share of the death-cum-retirement gratuity due to them will be paid to her on production of a certificate issued by the Tahasildar in whose jurisdiction the beneficiaries live, that the minor children are under her care and custody."

The power to reduce the pension under this rule has not been delegated by Government to subordinate authorities.\n2. If a subordinate authority considers that it is open to question whether the full pension admissible under rules should be granted to an employee owing to his unsatisfactory character and conduct, the pension application shall be submitted to the Government for orders with a concise statement of the unfavorable circumstances appearing against that employee and a sufficient explanation thereof to enable the Government to form an opinion as to the propriety of reducing the pension.\n3. Though Rule 59 (b) does not provide for an enquiry before taking action, the person affected may be given an opportunity of being heard to satisfy the principles of natural justice. A detailed enquiry is not necessary for reducing the pension, under this rule. But before ordering a reduction of pension the employee concerned may be given an opportunity to explain and vindicate himself as for instance when irregularities are detected after retirement and departmental proceedings are not feasible under Rule 3 ibid.\nRuling No.2\n* Reduction of pension in the case of retired employees cannot be ordered under the Kerala Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1960. In their case Rule 59 (b) of this Part is to be applied. No elaborate enquiry is necessary. But the retired employee concerned should be given an opportunity to explain and vindicate himself.\nRuling No.3\n** In cases where the Government orders reduction of pension under Rules 2,3,6 or 59 (b) of this Part it should be effected in whole rupees only so that the resultant pension may be paid in whole rupees even after effecting reductions.\nGovernment Decisions\n1. In the case of an employee who is compulsorily retired as a measure of penalty and sanctioned a reduced pension in accordance with the provisions of Rule 6 a further reduction under this rule may not be made.\n2. (a) This rule cannot be used directly to effect a penal recovery, but Government are justified in making proof of a specific instance of fraud or negligence by an employee, the grounds for a finding that his service has not been thoroughly satisfactory within the meaning of this rule for the purpose of reducing his pension.\n(b) The measure of the reduction in the amount of pension made under this rule should be the extent by which the employee\u2019s service as a whole has failed to reach thoroughly satisfactory, standard and any attempt to equate the amount of reduction with the amount of loss caused to Government is incorrect.\n(c) This rule contemplates permanent reduction in the amount of pension ordinarily admissible and does not admit of the reduction of the pension payable in respect of any one particular year.\n3. *Minimum pension is fixed in consideration of the bare subsistence needs and given a delinquent officer a pension sufficient to maintain a subsistence level, will not therefore be misplaced leniency. Government have, therefore, decided that minimum pension will be admissible even in cases where pension is ordered to be reduced as a punishment.\\"
