(2) money paid should under no circumstances be kept out of accounts a day longer than is absolutely necessary even though the payment is not covered by proper sanction. (3) inevitable payments should not be postponed even for the purpose of avoiding an excess over a grant or appropriation. (4) all actual liabilities should be ascertained, liquidated and payment recorded at the earliest possible date. (5) a disbursing officer may not on his own authority authorise any payment in excess of the funds placed at his disposal. But absence of funds should not necessarily prevent the payments of any sums really due by Government. If the disbursing officer is called upon to honour a claim which is certain to produce an excess over the allotment or appropriation at his disposal, he should take the orders of the administrative authority to which he is subordinate before authorising payment of the claim in question."

(b) An order sanctioning a temporary establishment should invariably specify the period for which it is sanctioned. It should also specify the date from which the sanction for a temporary establishment will take effect. If no date is specified, the sanction will take effect from the date of actual employment of the staff or of the Head of the staff. (c) When a person is appointed substantively to a post in a class or grade of appointments in an establishment over and above its sanctioned strength without at the same time increasing the sanctioned number of posts in the class or grade, the officer so appointed is termed a ‘Supernumerary’ in that class or grade. Such an appointment may be sanctioned by the Government, when owing to reduction in an establishment or for any other reasons, they consider it necessary to retain the services of an officer without adding to the permanent strength of the establishment. When such an appointment is sanctioned, it shall be the duty of the Head of the Department or office to absorb in the first vacancy, permanent or acting, that occurs in the class or grade after the appointment of the supernumerary and no vacancy occurring in that class or grade shall be filled up until all the existing supernumerary officers are absorbed. Supernumeraries should not be shown as belonging to a separate class by themselves, but should be shown as belonging to the particular class or grade to which each of them belongs, along with the other incumbents, constituting that class or grade. Note:– For the purpose of this rule, all the non-gazetted ministerial officers of an office or establishment shall be treated as belonging to a single class and similarly all the last grade Government servants."

In making appointments of ‘supernumeraries’ the following principles should be generally followed:- (i) A supernumerary post is normally created to accommodate the lien of an Officer, who in the opinion of the authority competent to create such a post is entitled to hold a lien against a regular permanent post but who, due to non-availability of a regular permanent post, cannot have his lien against such a post. (ii) It is normally a shadow post i.e., no duties are attached to such a post. The officer, whose lien is maintained against such a post, generally performs duties in some other vacant temporary or permanent post. (iii) It can be created only if another vacant permanent or temporary post is available to provide work for the person whose lien is retained by the creation of the supernumerary post. In other words, it should not be created in circumstances which, at the time of the creation of the post or thereafter, would lead to an excess of the working strength. (iv) It is always a permanent post. Since, however, it is a post created for accommodating a permanent officer till he is absorbed in a regular permanent posts, it should not be created for an indefinite period as other permanent posts are, but should normally be created, for a definite and fixed period sufficient for the purpose in view.

(iii) Rush purchases towards the end of the financial year should be avoided. Expenditure which might otherwise be postponed should not be incurred in the last month of the financial year solely with a view to prevent lapses of the budget grants. Such rush purchases have an undesirable effect in that the strict observance of the rules regarding invitation of the tenders, proper scrutiny of offers etc., are rendered impossible at such high pressure. Hasty purchases cannot but lead to waste, confusion and delay. (b) The articles should properly be classified under different trade groups according to the approved classification. Tenders should then be invited separately for each group. (i) The tenders should not be made unwieldy by including too many items of different kinds of materials in the same tender.

Purchasing Officers can avail themselves of these contracts, wherever it is economical and easier to do so. They should keep themselves conversant with the rules and procedure of the Director General of Supplies and Disposals Rate Contracts. The Stores Purchase Department is also concluding every year rate contract for a number of articles. In respect of purchases as per rate contracts settled by the Director General of Supplies and Disposals and the State Government, purchase sanction from Government is not necessary, even if the value of the purchase exceeds the purchase powers of the Purchasing Officer provided that it is specified while issuing administrative sanction, that the purchase will be made as per Director General of Supplies and Disposals/State Rate Contracts. In such cases, the selection of the type and make of the articles to be purchased will be made by the Purchasing Officer."

When he has done so, the verification prescribed in this Article need only be made, unless otherwise ordered in any case, when a Government servant to whom the duty has been delegated is transferred and the result of the verification should always be placed before the Head of the Office.  In spite of any such delegation, the Head of the Office still will be responsible for furnishing the certificate prescribed at the foot of the various contingent bills, etc., stating that the articles billed for have been brought into account, and for exercising a general control  so as  to ensure that the stores are properly safeguarded and the stock accounts properly maintained. Discrepancies found on Verification of Stores A deficiency detected during a verification of stores may be due to: (i) incorrect or careless accounting; (ii) loss arising from fraud, theft or negligence; or (iii) an unavoidable cause, e.g., wastage, shrinkage, spilling, etc., in the case of stores which are subject to them. The Head of the Office or institution concerned should  fully investigate the causes of any deficiency and send a full report on it to the controlling authority along with the verification report.  If he holds that any loss caused to the Government through a deficiency is due to misconduct or culpable negligence on  the  part  of  any  Government  servant  concerned,  he  should  add  his recommendation as to how the loss should be made good by recoveries from him.    The  controlling  authority  should,  after  such  examination  and investigation as the importance of the case warrants, issue or obtain from the competent  authority,  an  order  to  write  off  the  deficiency  from  the  stock accounts.  On receipt of this order the deficiency should be charged in the stock"

Repairs are further classified as “ordinary repairs” and “special repairs”.

Ordinary repairs to an irrigation work include all the operations required to maintain the work in a satisfactory state as it is, i.e., to the standard already laid down. Special repairs are repairs, which are not periodical or frequent e.g., re-roofing a building, replacing beams or renewing a floor. Special repairs to an irrigation work include all operations undertaken with a view to maintaining the work in a better condition, i.e., to a higher standard than that already laid down, by using materials of a more lasting kind, without increasing the efficiency or the scope of the system, e.g., substituting cement plastering or pointing for ordinary plastering or pointing, substituting plastering for pointing, substituting rough stone masonary for dry stone packing, revetting tank bunds at the sites of beaches and river margins where they are eroded, grouting newly the surface of aprons and revetments and lengthening aprons and revetments to protect the eroded por"

Note:— The system to be adopted in the case of jail works should be as follows:— When jail works are executed by the contract system, jail labour should be employed by the contractors on all unskilled items of works connected with the contract as far as possible. Therefore when tenders are called for, for the work  it should be stipulated in the tender notice that the contractor should employ jail labour on all unskilled items of work connected with contract if such labour  is available with the Jail Department and that the jail labour, if supplied, will be charged for at the rate prescribed for the purpose. A similar procedure should be adopted in regard to jail works executed departmentally by the Public Works Department. In cases in which jail labour is not employed on a work for the reason that the Jail Department is not able to supply it, a written  statement  from  the  Jail  Superintendent  to  that  effect  should  be obtained and recorded by the Public Works Department Officers.

Such works should ordinarily be undertaken by the departments using or requiring them, utilising the funds placed at their disposal in the budget. The works described above should not involve structural alterations and additions to buildings in–charge of the Public Works Department. When they involve structural alteration and additions to such buildings, civil officers should obtain the concurrence of the Executive Engineer for the same and should also communicate to the Executive Engineer, the actual cost incurred so that the capital accounts of the buildings may be correctly maintained. If repairs are sanctioned to the roof of a building occupied by more than one department, they should be of a trifling nature.

In a great emergency it may sometimes be impossible to obtain the necessary labour in time otherwise than through a contractor. If it is possible, in such a case , to determine the quantity of work done after its completion or at intervals during its progress, the contractor should be paid at suitable rates for the work actually done. If this is not practicable, the contractor may be paid according to the number of labourers employed each day, and his own profit or commission should either be included in the rates allowed or paid separately in a lump sum or at a percentage rate. With a view to avoiding disputes with the contractor in such a case, he should be requested to sign the daily reports in token that he accepts them as correct. The muster roll and the measurement book should not be used when the contractor is paid according to the number of labourers employed each day."

Pay in respect of provisional appointments may be treated as officiating pay for this purpose and taken into account for calculating the eligible amount of advance, provided such appointments have been continuing for a period of twelve months and where Government consider that there is little chance of the officer being reverted to a lower post. Note 1:— The term actual price includes the price of such items which have necessarily  to  be  purchased  along  with  the  motor  conveyance  (or  in other words, on the purchase of which the purchaser has no choice), e.g., spare wheel, tyre and tube, pillion seat in a scooter. Where, however, certain accessories (e.g., radio in a car, plastic covers) are purchased which are not essential and which the customer purchases of his own volition,  the term ‘actual price’ will not cover their cost. Insurance and registration charges which are incurred for running the motor vehicle cannot be included in the actual price of the vehicle."

When necessary, the administrative authority may ask the Accountant General to furnish all vouchers and other documents in his possession that may be relevant to the investigation. If the investigation is so complex as to require the assistance of an expert audit officer, the administrative authority should report the facts to the Government and request them to obtain the services of an audit officer to assist in the investigation. If the Government depute an audit officer for the purpose, the administrative authority and the audit officer will be personally responsible, within their respective spheres, for completing the investigation expeditiously."

Whenever an administrative authority holds that a Government servant is responsible for a loss sustained by the Government, it should always consider both whether the whole or any part of the loss should be recovered from him in money and whether any other form of disciplinary action should be taken. In deciding the amount to be recovered, it should consider not only the circumstances of the loss but also the Government servant’s financial position, since the penalty should not be such as to impair his future efficiency. Whenever a loss is held to be due to fraud on the part of a Government servant or servants, every endeavour should be made to recover the whole amount lost from the guilty persons. If the failure of a superior officer to exercise proper supervision and control has facilitated the fraud, he should be called strictly to account and suitably dealt with after carefully assessing his personal responsibility in the matter, e.g., by recovering from him in money a suitable proportion of the loss, or by stopping his increments or reducing the pay. Whenever any Government property or equipment is lost, damaged or destroyed on account of the carelessness of a Government servant to whom it is entrusted (e.g., a police-man’s rifle, a factory motor, lorry or an Engineer’s instruments), the appropriate administrative authority should always consider whether the amount of the loss sustained by the Government should not be recovered in full up to the limit of the Government servant’s capacity to pay. Note:— Interest at 18 per cent per annum or at such rate as fixed by Government from time to time should be charged."

Similarly, the fact that it is not possible to fix responsibility on the officials who initiated or acquiesced in the initiation of any irregularity resulting in loss to Government will not exonerate those who subsequently acquiesced in the continuation of the irregularity. It is the duty of  all Government officials to look after the financial interests  of  Government  and  Government  will  hold  their  officers responsible for such irregularities, not only those who originated them but also those who subsequently permitted their continuance. The following general principles should be followed in fixing monetary liabilities so far as the Government servants are concerned : (i) It should be carefully noted that personal monetary liability would arise only when pecuniary loss is sustained by Government.  Irregularities in the maintenance of accounts or in the sanction of expenditure would not involve  monetary  liability  as  long  as  no  loss  to  Government  is  caused. Distinction  should  be  drawn  between  objections  involving  loss  to Government  and  other  objections  in  an  audit  report. The  latter  will  not constitute monetary liability and will call for other forms of disciplinary action wherever justified.

(c) Loss or extra expenditure arising out of administrative lapses e.g., payment of demurrage charges, payment of surcharge (Final) on electricity bills and Radio Licence fees, expenditure incurred in excess of one’s powers not ratified by the competent authority, purchases effected in violation of Stores Purchase Rules resulting in extra expenditure, printing charges to private firms in excess of approved rates, sanctioning posts in schools in excess of the limits prescribed, irregular grant of fee concessions, stipends, etc., loss of revenue due to wrong assessment of claims becoming time-barred, etc. Recovery in cash is called for in respect of categories (a) and (b). In regard to category (c), cash recovery should ordinarily arise only if mala fides are proved. The term “malafides” may be defined in this context as a state of mind where the Officer may be deemed to have acted with the intention to be benefited directly or indirectly by such action. In other cases falling under category (c), it should be seen whether the types of irregularities previously pointed out have been repeated. If the irregularities have been repeated or are of a serious nature or magnitude, the question of taking other forms of disciplinary action if the officer concerned is still in service or of reducing pension under the Service Rules if already retired, should be considered."

In such cases the degree/extent of personal responsibility of each individual should first be fixed strictly with reference to his duties and responsibilities and the extent to which he neglected them. The fact that a Government servant has been misled or deceived by a subordinate will, in no way mitigate his personal responsibility since every government servant should be familiar with the financial rules laid down by the Government and exercise a specially strict and close control over his subordinates in regard to the use of Public Funds and the maintenance of proper accounts. Having fixed the personal responsibility of each individual in the above manner, cash recovery/other forms of disciplinary action should be ordered with reference to such responsibility. In ordering cash recovery, the Government servant’s financial position should also be taken into consideration. In cases where it is not possible to recover the share so fixed from one or more individuals due to their death or for other reasons the question may be taken up for obtaining sanction from the competent authority for the loss to be written off. It should however, be ensured that the necessity for a write off should not arise for want of timely and adequate action to fix personal responsibility and the amount to be recovered from each individual."
