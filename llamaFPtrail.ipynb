Explanation.—Under the provisions of the Reserve Bank of India Act, the  amount  of  currency  and  bank  notes  in  circulation, which constitute the liabilities of the Issue Department of  the  Bank,  should  not  exceed  the  assets  of  that department held in gold, sterling securities, rupee coin (including rupee notes), and rupee securities. A portion of  these  assets  is  held  in  the  various  currency  chests in the form of rupee coin and rupee notes. The currency and  bank  notes  held  in  these  chests  are  notes  in circulation but pass into circulation only when they are transferred to the treasury balances. Assuming that there are  no  transactions  elsewhere,  the  deposit  of  currency and bank notes in a currency chest decreases the amount of such notes in a circulation and the deposit of rupees and  rupee  notes  inthe  chest  increase  the  assets  of  the Issue Department of the Bank. A deposit notes or coin in a currency chest thus enables the Bank to issue notes elsewhere    upto    the      amount      deposited  without increasing the total amount of the notes in circulation. If, therefore, a transfer of funds from the treasury balance at ‘A’ to the treasury balance at ‘B’ is required, this can be  effected  at  short  notice  and  without  the  actual remittance of coin or notes by transferring money from the  treasury  balance  to  the  currency  chest  at  ‘A’  and transferring  the  same  amount  from  them  enables  the treasury balance at a treasury or sub treasury to be kept at a low figure, as it is always possible to replenish the balance quickly by a transfer of money from the currency chest.
