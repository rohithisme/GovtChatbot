In the same way the period from 30th January to 2nd March should be reckoned as 1 month and 2 days, because one month from 30th January ends on 28th February. A period of one month and 29 days commencing from 1st January will expire in an ordinary year (in which February is a month of 28 days) on the last day of February because a period of 29 days cannot obviously mean to exceed a period of full calendar month and leave for two months from 1st January would end on the last day of  February. The same would be the case if February were a month of  29 days or if the broken period were 28 days (in an ordinary year)."

Where, however, a resignation has become effective, the officer is no longer in Government service and acceptance of the request for withdrawal of resignation would amount to re-employing him in service after condoning the period of break.

The Government servant’s earlier service will not count for fixation of pay, increment or leave.

The words ‘his old pay’ in the proviso of the rule should be held to include not only the rate at which the individual was drawing his officiating pay on the crucial date but also the time-scale of pay in which he was drawing that pay.

This practice has since been reviewed in the light of the procedure followed in some of the Audit and Account offices of other States. It has been decided that no authorisation from the office of the Accountant General is necessary in case of additional charge arrangements from 1st April 1963 onwards, as holding of additional charge of a gazetted post does not alter the status of a non gazetted officer to that of a gazetted officer. According to the changed procedure, the additional charge allowance will be drawn and paid by the Head of Office in the same manner as his regular pay and allowances are drawn. The Drawing Officer should however satisfy himself that there is proper sanction of the competent authority for the additional charge arrangements and that the officer has actually held the additional charge of the post during the period for which the charge allowance is drawn and also that the rate of allowance sanctioned and drawn is as per rules etc."

(ii) A day is also allowed for any fractional portion of any distance prescribed in clause (a) (ii). (c) When part of the journey is by steamer, the limit of six days for preparation may be extended to cover any period unavoidably spent in awaiting the departure of the steamer. (d) Travel by road not exceeding eight kilometres to or from a railway station or steamer ghat at the beginning or end of journey does not count for joining time. (e) A Sunday does not count as a day for the purpose of the calculations in this rule, but Sundays are included in the maximum period of 30 days. Exception 1.- The authority sanctioning the transfer may, in special circumstances, reduce the period of joining time admissible under this rule. Exception 2.- In the case of officers who are entrusted with the custody of stores, a period of not more than ten days and in the case of officers in charge of Timber Depots of the Forest Department a period of not more than one week will be allowed for transfer of charge of check conjointly stores and other materials, the minimum time actually required in each case alone being, however, utilised for the purpose. Exception 3.- A period of not more than one week will be allowed to Forest Guards for transfer of charge and join perambulation of the beats, the minimum time actually required alone being, however, utilised for the purpose. This period will be treated as an extension of joining time in respect of the relieving officer."
